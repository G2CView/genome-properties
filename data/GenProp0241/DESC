CC  The capability to degrade phosphonates is believed to consist minimally
CC   of a system for transporting phosphonate compounds (those with
CC  carbon-PO3 linkages) coupled with a pathway for the hydrolysis of such
CC  bonds. Two classes of system are known, those that handle broad classes
CC  of phosphonate compounds and those that handle specific molecules.
CC  Genomes with evidence for either system will be assigned the YES state
CC  for this property.
**  Futher transport and hydrolysis systems as of yet unmodelled most
**  likely exist.
