CC  Cyanobacteria have a system of proteins, KaiABC, capable of generating
CC  rhythmic oscillations in the expression of other genes with a period of
CC  about a day. KaiC performs autophosphorylations, modulated by its
CC  interactions with the other clock proteins, and appears to act as
CC  transcriptional repressor. This remarkable system can continue its
CC  oscillations even in the absence of transcription and translation of
CC  kaiABC itself. KaiB and KaiC, at least, may be universal among the
CC  Cyanobacteria. Homologs outside the Cyanobacteria and paralogs within,
CC  both with uncertain function, occur for KaiB and KaiC.
