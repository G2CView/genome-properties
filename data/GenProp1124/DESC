CC  Binds glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and glycerol-3-phosphocholine (GPC)
CC  and functions as an ATPase. It is thought to facilitate G3P transport
CC  into the cell. Genetic studies have shown that excess phosphate in the
CC  cell can inhibit the Ugp transporter but this observation has not been
CC  replicated in vitro.
