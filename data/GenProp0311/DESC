RT  Who's competent and when: regulation of natural genetic competence in
RT  bacteria.
RA  Solomon JM, Grossman AD;
RL  Trends Genet. 1996;12:150-155.
CC  Competence is the ability of a cell to take up exogenous DNA from its 
CC  environment, resulting in transformation. It is widespread among bacteria 
CC  and is probably an important mechanism for the horizontal transfer of 
CC  genes. DNA usually becomes available by the death and lysis of other cells. 
CC  Competent bacteria use components of extracellular filaments called type 4 
CC  pili to create pores in their membranes and pull DNA through the pores into 
CC  the cytoplasm. This process, including the development of competence and 
CC  the expression of the uptake machinery, is regulated in response to 
CC  cell-cell signalling and/or nutritional conditions [1].
**  Some uptake sequences: Neisseria ATGCCGTCTGAA, most Pasteurellacaea
**  AAAGTGCGGT, and alternative Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae ACAAGCGGTC
