CC  Plays a role in chemotaxis, the movement toward or away from chemicals.
CC  The flagellar motor of bacteria is a rotary device energized by the
CC  membrane ion gradient and the complex is required for the rotation and
CC  directional switching of the flagellum and also functions in flagellar
CC  assembly. Motor torque is produced at the top of the switch complex,
CC  where the FliG C-terminal domain bears several conserved charged
CC  residues that interact with charged groups of the stator protein MotA
CC  (P09348). The conformation of this complex is such that the flagellum
CC  rotates in a clockwise (CW) direction, induced by binding of CheY-P to
CC  the lower part of the C-ring. CheY-P interacts initially with the
CC  N-terminal segment of FliM, which is flexible enough to allow
CC  subsequent binding to a site on FliN. Coupled conformational
CC  transitions in FliM  trigger large displacements of a distant
CC  alpha-helix in FliG, involved in stator contacts, inducing the change
CC  of the flagellar rotors from counterclocwise (smooth-swimming
CC  phenotype) to clockwise rotation (tumbly phenotype).
