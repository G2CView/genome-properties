CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats. The repeats vary in size from 24 to 48 bp,
CC  interspaced by similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. These spacers
CC  often are derived from phage and other exogenous DNA, are transcribed
CC  into RNA, and confer resistance to those same phage. Several
CC  CRISPR-associated sequences (cas genes) are nearly as widespread as
CC  CRISPR itself and nearly always are found near repeat loci. Others
CC  represent minor cas genes that serve as markers for specific subtypes
CC  of CRISPR/cas system, each with characteristic cas gene makeup, repeat
CC  structure, and spacer length. The Nmeni subtype, so named because this
CC  subtype is the only one found in the genome of Neisseria meningitidis,
CC  consists of cas1 and cas2 and the subtype specific genes csn1-2. This
CC  subtype has the most limited suite of cas core genes of any subtype
CC  defined thus far. The repeats associated with this subtype tend to
CC  have a periodicity of 66 nucleotides. This subtype is found only in
CC  Bacteria, and notably it would seem only in known or potential (i.e.
CC  containing virulence genes) vertebrate pathogens.
