CC  Polyketides are an important class of natural product which are 
CC  assembled by the sequential addition of units containing a minimum of 
CC  one acetate group. Polyketides include many antibiotics and other 
CC  compounds of biological and economic importance. Polyketides may be 
CC  synthesized by large multi-domain proteins (Type I polyketide 
CC  synthetases) which carry out a so-called thio-template program in which 
CC  successive modules of domains add single units to the growing end of 
CC  the polyketide chain, modify the newly added piece (usually a series of 
CC  reductions) and pass the chain on to the next module. The overall 
CC  mechanism is similar to that observed in the biosynthesis of fatty 
CC  acids in animals via the Type I fatty acid synthases. By contrast, 
CC  Type II polyketide synthetases, which are similar to the Type II fatty 
CC  acid synthases found in bacteria and plants, consist of separate 
CC  proteins for each of the various functions involved in the overall 
CC  process. Plant chalcones and stilbenes are synthesized by yet a third 
CC  style of synthetase in which a single condensing enzyme is active for 
CC  all condensation steps. This property describes the presence of the
CC  minimum set of constituent domains required for prodcution of a 
CC  polyketide chain, in either one single gene, or two consecutive genes.
**  Many of the constituent domains of type I polyketide synthetases have 
**  been defined by HMM models. These include acyl transferase (PF00698),
**  beta-ketoacyl-synthase (PF00109, PF02801), acyl carrier protein
**  (PF00550) and thioesterase (PF00975) domains.  Other commonly found
**  domains which have not yet been represented by HMMs include
**  ketoreductase, dehydratase and enoyl reductase domains. This genome
**  property will be set to YES if any single gene in the genome contains
**  domains corresponding to PF00698, PF00109, PF02801 and PF00550.  (These
**  correspond to the minimum set of domains for production of a polyketide
**  chain.)  Failing that condition, a YES will be set if two consecutive
**  genes in combination contain all of these domains (as type I polyketide
**  synthetases are sometimes found as multiple genes broken up between
**  some, but not all, of the domains).  Otherwise, the propery will be set
**  to NO.  A NULL value indicates that the genome has not yet been
**  evaluated with regard to this property.
