CC  An exonuclease complex essential in DNA double-strand break repair by
CC  homologous recombination. It catalyzes the unwinding of double-stranded
CC  DNA at DNA damage sites and cleaves the resulting single-stranded DNA
CC  (through RecB activity). This process is ATP-hydrolysis-dependent which
CC  is provided by the ATPase activity of RecD. The two helicases act with
CC  opposite polarity: RecB is an SF1A enzyme with a 3'–5' polarity and
CC  RecD an SF1B enzyme with a 5'–3' polarity. They cooperate to unwind
CC  DNA in a highly processive manner where the DNA gets unwound in the
CC  RecB-RecC interface with the 5'ssDNA single-strand fed into the RecD
CC  subunit and the 3'ssDNA remaining in the RecB-RecC dimer. The nuclease
CC  activity of the RecB subunit might be regulated by the RecD protein. A
CC  mutant lacking the the N-terminal 1B domain of RecD loses its helicase
CC  function completely.
