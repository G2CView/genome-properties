RT  Crystal structure of the Klebsiella pneumoniae NFeoB/FeoC complex and
RT  roles of FeoC in regulation of Fe2+ transport by the bacterial Feo
RT  system.

CC  The proteins FeoA, FeoB, and FeoC are a bacterial ferrous iron
CC  transport system. No siderophores are involved. Ferrous iron (Fe(2+))
CC  typically is present only during oxygen limitation.
