CC  Analogous to YSIRK, this property describes a subclass of N-terminal
CC  signal sequence in Firmicutes (low-GC Gram-positive bacteria). As with
CC  YSIRK, many proteins with this N-terminal domain have an LPXTG
CC  C-terminal anchor. However, most of these proteins have extended
CC  regions of low-complexity sequence, usually serine-rich. We propose
CC  that this signal domain is recognized by cellular machinery that delays
CC  protein translocation until glycosylation or other post-translational
CC  modifications are complete.
