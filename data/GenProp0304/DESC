CC  Methanocaldococcus jannaschii is a model archaeal species that lacks a
CC  direct cys--tRNA ligase. In a system analogous to pyrrolysine and (in
CC  many species) asparagine tRNA aminoacylation, the tRNA is misacylated
CC  and then the attached amino acid is modified. This two-step pathway is
CC  conducted by proteins in the families of MJ1660 (sepS) and MJ1678
CC  (pscS). This pathway assumes 0-phosphoserine, whose biosynthesis is 
CC  proposed to require D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (TIGR01327) and
CC  an unidentified aminotransferase.
**  Consider adding to this property TIGR01327, as in MJ1018,
**  D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, in route to phosphoserine
**  biosynthesis along with an unknown aminotransferase.
