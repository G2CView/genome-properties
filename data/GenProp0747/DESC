CC  This two-step pathway in purine biosynthesis begins with IMP (inosine
CC  monophosphate), a branch point in purine de novo biosynthesis.
CC  Adenylosuccinate synthetase, product of the PurA gene, catalyzes the 
CC  first committed step to AMP. Adenylosuccinate lyase, product of the 
CC  purB gene, catalyzes the second and final step, but it also catalyzes 
CC  the eighth step in IMP biosynthesis.
**  So PurA is marker for this property and PurB is not, since it is shared
**  with 4051
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0110.
