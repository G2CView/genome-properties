CC  The SOS response controls both accurate and potentially mutagenic DNA
CC  repair functions, and requires the recA and lexA gene products. LexA is
CC  a repressor protein that binds to a site (the SOS box) located near the
CC  promoters of the SOS response genes and interferes with the binding of
CC  RNA polymerase. The recA gene product is required not only for the
CC  regulation of the SOS response, but also for homologous recombination
CC  and for various other DNA repair and damage tolerance pathways.
**  Unsure whether or not to include recBCD and others into this property.
