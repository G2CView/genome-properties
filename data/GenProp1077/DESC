RT  The modified wobble nucleoside uridine-5-oxyacetic acid in
RT  tRNAPro(cmo5UGG) promotes reading of all four proline codons in vivo.

CC  The tRNA methyltransferases CmoA and CmoB, usually encoded by tandem
CC  genes, work together to complete a tRNA wobble position modification,
CC  uridine-5-oxyacetic acid (cmo5U). This modification was shown to allow
CC  a tRNA(Pro) to recognize all four proline codons. This system has a
CC  fairly narrow taxonomic range, including E. coli, in which cmoA and
CC  cmoB occur but are not essential.
**  H. pylori and actually all Helicobacter species have an N-terminally
**  truncated form of CmoB, TIGR00452, relative to orthologs in other
**  species. Model TIGR00452 rebuilt.
