CC  Model TIGR03769 describes a protein region that occurs several times
CC  per genome in several Actinobacteria. Typically, it occurs once in an
CC  ABC transporter substrate binding protein and two to three times in a
CC  neighboring gene that is anchored to the Gram-positive cell wall by a
CC  sortase/LPXTG system. This genome property describes the three genes of
CC  the ABC transporter cassette and the neighboring LPXTG-anchored repeat
CC  protein. This system is analogous to the NEAT domain system found in
CC  some pathogenic Firmicutes.
**  I will call this A.R.T. (anchored repeat transport).
**  P. acnes = Propionibacterium acnes, also known as Cutibacterium acnes.
**  Of the five reference proteomes, only that from strain DSM 16379 has
**  proteins in all steps in this GenomeProperty.
