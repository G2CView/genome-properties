CC  Insulin is synthesized as a precursor. It is processed to
CC  generate insulin A and B chains, which are disulfide-linked,
CC  and the C-peptide [1]. Processing occurs at dibasic 
CC  residues [2] and the C-terminal dibasics are removed 
CC  sequentially by a carboxypeptidase [3].

**  Neuroendocrine convertase 1 (PCSK2) can perform some of the
