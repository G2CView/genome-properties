CC  This Genome Property consists of a form of ATP-energized transport in
CC  which two subunits resemble ABC transporter ATP-binding subunits, but
CC  the other two are distinct. The T component marks the transporter
CC  class, and generally is encoded adjacent the ATP-binding subunits. The
CC  substrate capture component S spans the membrane multiple times, and
CC  somewhat more than half the time is encoded away from the other
CC  subunits. In these systems, a single T subunit may transfer energy to a
CC  number of different S subunits.
**  The upstream and downstream transporters may be more similar to each
**  other within a pair than to either member of a different pair. So the
**  models built so far are not comprehensive, and these steps are in-rule
**  0 for now.  WARNING - SEE HOW MUCH REPAIR NEEDED FOR GenProp0277,
**  cobalt.
