CC  This property describes a putative bacterial C-terminal protein-sorting
CC  system restricted to the Synergistetes, but not universal in that
CC  lineage. Model genomes from at least seven genera average ten proteins
CC  apiece with the Synergist-CTERM signal. Some protein-sorting signals
CC  have the signature motif separated from the transmembrane helix (TM) by
CC  a spacer region (e.g. LPXTG and MYXO-CTERM) while others are have it
CC  flush against the TM (PGF-CTERM, GlyGly-CTERM, and this one). The lack
CC  of spacer suggests that the unknown sorting enzyme is a multiple
CC  membrane-spanning protein, like archaeosortase and rhombosortase,
CC  rather than a predominantly hydrophilic enzyme like sortase, whose
CC  targets have a spacer.
**  Jonquetella lacks. Pyramidobacter piscolens, its twin, also lacks.
**  Thermovirga lienii lacks. May be sporadic. Dethiosulfovibrio
**  peptidovorans, Aminiphilus circumscriptus, Aminomonas paucivorans,
**  Fretibacterium fastidiosum, Cloacibacillus evryensis, Synergistes
**  jonesii all have.
