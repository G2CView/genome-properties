CC  Blood coagulation is the cross-linking of fibrin fibres.  Conversion
CC  of the precursor fibrinogen to active fibrin is a prerequisite.  
CC  Activation requires proteolytic removal of an N-terminal peptide
CC  from each of the fibrinogen chains, allowing isopeptide bonds to form  
CC  between active fibrin chains.  A proteolytic cascade to amplify the
CC  initial signal results in the activation of thrombin (factor 2) which
CC  releases the fibrinopeptides from fibrin [1].  The transglutaminase
CC  factor XIII catalyzes the formation of gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine 
CC  cross-links between fibrin chains. Two converging pathways are
CC  thought to exist, the extrinsic and the intrinsic.  The extrinsic 
CC  pathway is initiated by the release of tissue factor.
**  The existance of the intrinsic pathway has been called into question, 
**  and the extrinsic pathway has been simplified.  This coagulation 
**  pathway is restricted to vertebrates.  Invertebrates have a different
**  pathway (determined in the horseshoe crab).
