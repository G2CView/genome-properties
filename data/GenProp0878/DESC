RT  Lysine-2,3-aminomutase and beta-lysine acetyltransferase genes of
RT  methanogenic archaea are salt induced and are essential for the
RT  biosynthesis of Nepsilon-acetyl-beta-lysine and growth at high
RT  salinity.

CC  N(epsilon)-acetyl-beta-lysine is a compatible solute produced in
CC  methanogenic archaea under salt stress. Note that the first enzyme in
CC  this two-step pathway can instead serve as the first step in lysine
CC  catabolism, as in Clostridium subterminale SB4 [1].
**  Includes Methanosarcina mazei, Methanosarcina acetivorans,
**  Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanococcus maripaludis. I wrote a letter
**  9/14/2009 to Prof. Dr. Erhard Bremer, who works on compatible solutes
**  in Bacillus, to ask about AblA/AlbB predictions outside the archaea.
