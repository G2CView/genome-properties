CC  CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat), is
CC  an adaptive immune system that provides protection against mobile
CC  genetic elements (viruses, transposable elements and conjugative
CC  plasmids). The system memorizes previous infections by integrating
CC  short sequences of invading genomes (spacers) into the CRISPR locus.
CC  The spacers, interspaced with repeats, are expressed as small guide
CC  CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that are employed by Cas proteins to target
CC  invaders, sequence-specifically, upon a recurring infection. The
CC  Cas1-Cas2 complex is essential for the incorporation of 33-bp long
CC  sequence-variable foreign DNA protospacers into the host CRISPR locus.
CC  CRISPR transcripts generated from the loci assemble with Cas proteins
CC  to detect and cleave foreign nucleic acids bearing sequence
CC  complementarity to the spacer segment. Cas1 is the probable nuclease
CC  that catalyzes the integration reaction, whilst Cas2 may provide a
CC  structural scaffold and stimulate the catalytic activity of Cas1.
