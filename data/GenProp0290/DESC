RT  The function of adenosylcobalamin in the mechanism of ribonucleoside
RT  triphosphate reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii.

CC  Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are responsible for the conversion of
CC  the ribose sugar of RNA into the deoxyribose sugar of DNA. This is the
CC  rate-limiting step of DNA biosynthesis. The class II RNRs consist of a
CC  single subunit and generate the required radical  via an
CC  adenosylcobalamin (B12) cofactor. The most common gene symbols for
CC  this gene is NrdJ, although the gene in mycobacterium is called NrdZ. 
CC  The first characterized NrdJ gene, from Lactobacillus leichmannii,
CC  acted specifically on nucleoside triphosphates like the class III
CC  enzymes (1.17.4.2) and unlike the class I enzymes which act on the
CC  diphosphates (1.17.4.1). However, as further B12-dependent RNRs were
CC  characterized, it became clear that this is the exception rather than
CC  the rule. This property captures both types.
