CC  This two-step, ATP-dependent pathway for urea hydrolysis is an
CC  alternative to urease. Urease requires a transporter and accessory
CC  proteins to produce its nickel metallocenter, while this two-step
CC  system uses biotin. Urea carboxylase acts first in this pathway,
CC  requiring ATP and bicarbonate as substrates. Allophanate hydrolase acts
CC  next, but note that this enzyme may be found in systems that do not
CC  contain a urea carboxylase. In yeasts such as Saccaromyces cerevisiae,
CC  the two activities of this pathway are encoded in a fusion protein,
CC  designated urea amidolyase. This pathway appears to function primarily
CC  for the purpose of obtaining nitrogen in the form of ammonia. A pair of
CC  uncharacterized, tandem, homologous genes, restricted to organisms with
CC  this system and adjacent to the known genes, have been added to this
CC  Genome Property.
