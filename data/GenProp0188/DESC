CC  The GatABC heterotrimer acts as an alternative to direct aminoacylation
CC  of tRNA(Gln), tRNA(Asn), or both with its respective amino acid.
CC  Rather, the tRNA may be misacylated with Glu in the place of Gln, or
CC  Asp in the place of Asn. The phylogenetic ranges over which GatABC
CC  orthologs act on Glu-tRNA(Gln), Asp-tRNA(Asn), or both are not fully
CC  worked out. It is both in Chlamydia, the Thermus-Deinococcus lineage,
CC  and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. In the Archaea, GatDE act on
CC  Glu-tRNA(Gln) while GatABC act on Asp-tRNA(Asn). In Lactobacillus and
CC  possibly all Firmicutes, GatABC acts on Glu-tRNA(Gln) only. Note that
CC  the amidotransferase reaction is a mechanism not only to charge a tRNA
CC  with Asn or Gln, but to complete the synthesis of that amino acid.
