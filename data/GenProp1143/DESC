CC  Catalyzes the terminal step of anaerobic respiration. Electrons are
CC  donated to membrane-bound subunits FrdC and FrdD by 2 quinol
CC  (hydroquinone) molecules and transferred to a flavin adenine nucleotide
CC  (FAD, covalently-bound to subunit FrdA) through three distinct Fe-S
CC  clusters (within subunit FrdB). Ultimately, the electrons are used to
CC  reduce FAD-bound fumarate to succinate. Electrons can also be
CC  transported in the opposite direction where they are donated by
CC  succinate and ultimately reduce quinone to quinol. Member of the Complex
CC  II family. The functionally inverse complex found in aerobic
CC  respiration is the SQR complex (CPX-1931).
