CC  The Wzx/Wzy/Wzz system transports the O-antigen monomers from the
CC  cytoplasmic face of the plama membrane to the periplamic face and then
CC  polymerizes the monomers to form the mature O-antigen. The Wzx protein
CC  is the transporter (aka the flippase), Wzy is the polymerase and Wzz is
CC  the chain length determinant protein.
**  Note that Pfam model PF04932, Wzy_C, was previously designated
**  O-antigen polymerase, but is now designated O-antigen ligase, the
**  enzyme that transfers the carbohydrate (made by polymerizing the
**  oligosaccharide repeat unit) from is undecaprenyl-PP carrier to the LPS
**  outer core, making complete LPS. TIGR04370 models an oligosaccharide
**  repeat unit polymerase.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0724, GP0912, GP0931.
**  Evidence for step 3 is also used for GP0912, GP0932, GP0947, GP0953 and GP0973.
