CC  Many pathogenic bacteria produce an exopolysaccharide based on
CC  poly-N-acetylglucosamine. It is an important factor in biofilm
CC  formation and therefore virulence. Modifications (as by polysaccharide
CC  N-deacetylase) and attachments differ from system to system. This
CC  Genome Property describes the variant associated with the IcaADBC
CC  operon as found in Staphylococcus epidermidis. Biosynthesis begins with
CC  UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, polymerized with beta-1,6 linkages, followed
CC  by incomplete deacetylation. 
**  Saw it described as a glycan of beta-1,6-linked
**  2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosyl.
