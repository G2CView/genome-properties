CC  Nickel is an essential trace element, but is also toxic in high levels. 
CC  This genome property descibed a specifc ABC transporter that is responsible 
CC  for the uptake of nickel. The transporter is encoded by the nikABCDE operon.
CC  This property also includes nikR which has been shown to function as a 
CC  regulator for this transporter, allowing the nickel levels to be maintained
CC  at a non-toxic level [1,2,3].
