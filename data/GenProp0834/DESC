CC  The proteasome, a large complex formed of alpha and beta subunits,
CC  performs protein degradation in eukaryotes, archaea, and bacteria. This
CC  Genome Property describes a bacterial 20S proteasome that approximates
CC  being restricted to and universal in the Actinobacteria. Nearly all
CC  bacterial with this proteasomal system use pupylation to tag proteins
CC  as proteasomal targets. The HslVU system in many bacteria is related,
CC  with HslV homologous to the proteasome beta subunit, but that system is
CC  outside the scope of the archaeal-type bacterial 20S proteasome
CC  described here.
