CC  Toxin-antitoxin (TA) system that appears to be a principal mediator of
CC  cell death in biofilm formations. TA systems act as effectors of
CC  dormancy and persistence and are composed of a toxin, which causes
CC  growth arrest by interfering with a vital cellular process, and a
CC  cognate antitoxin, which neutralizes the toxin activity during normal
CC  growth conditions. Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are
CC  selectively degraded, leaving the toxins to exert their toxic effects,
CC  leading to growth arrest and dormancy. Type II TA complexes are small
CC  protein-protein pairs; under growth conditions, the toxin is bound to
CC  the antitoxin, which inhibits its activity. Both the antitoxin and, in
CC  most cases, the TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress
CC  transcription. Under stress conditions, cellular proteases such as Lon
CC  (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176) are activated that preferentially cleave
CC  the antitoxins, freeing the toxins to inhibit growth by inhibiting
CC  translation or replication, enabling cells to enter a metabolically
CC  dormant state until the stress is removed. The toxin YafQ degrades mRNA
CC  at adenosine-rich codons, most likely while it is bound to the
CC  ribosome. The binding of DinJ occludes the active site of YafQ and a
CC  single YafQ-(DinJ)2-YafQ complex bound to one inverted repeat in one of
CC  two palindromic operator regions in the dinJ promoter represses
CC  transcription.
