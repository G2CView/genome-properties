CC  The hutW and hutX genes are found in Vibrio cholerae next to hutZ,
CC  which is essential for heme utilization. HutW is homologous to the heme
CC  carrier protein HemS, while HutW is homologous to (but does not
CC  complement) the heme biosynthesis protein HemN. The gene pair is
CC  occasionally fused, and may perform a salvage-like function, converting
CC  one form of heme into another. HutZ, which resembles the PPOX class
CC  heme oxidase HugZ, accompanies roughly half of the occurrences of HutW
CC  and HutX.
