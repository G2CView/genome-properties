CC  Transmembrane complex that mediates resistance to copper and silver by
CC  cation efflux directly from the cell using the proton-motive force.
CC  Spans the inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane. CusF delivers
CC  metal ions to the CusCBA tripartite efflux system in the periplasm,
CC  CusB then appears to deliver the bound metal ion from CusB  to the
CC  three-methionine cluster (Met-573, Met-623 and Met-672) inside the
CC  periplasmic cleft of CusA from where it is passed into the central
CC  funnel of CusA and eventually the CusC channel for final extrusion.
CC  Primarily activated under anaerobic conditions by CusR (P0ACZ8) and
CC  CusS (P77485) but also expressed under extreme copper stress, in
CC  aerobic growth.
