CC  Pairs of genes are often found to maintain plasmids by a mechanism of
CC  post-segregational killing. One protein is a short-lived antidote, the
CC  other a long-lived toxin, and the two encoded together. Loss of the
CC  gene pair, as from a cell division in which one of the daughter cells
CC  does not receive a copy of the plasmid, leads to loss of the antidote
CC  faster than the toxin, and therefore to cell death. Such pairs are
CC  called addition modules, and may be chromosomal rather than plasmid.
CC  Chromosomal pairs frequently have mRNA-cleaving activity with
CC  bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal activity, and may benefit the
CC  host cell by enabling a persister state in response to certain
CC  challenges.
