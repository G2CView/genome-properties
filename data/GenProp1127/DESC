CC  Role in thiamine biosynthesis, catalysing the synthesis of the thiazole
CC  phosphate moiety of thiamine. ThiG-ThiH is found downstream of the
CC  activities of IscS, the ThiS-ThiF complex (CPX-2134) and ThiI, and
CC  requires the activity of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP). The ThiH
CC  subunit binds a 4Fe-4S cluster that is coordinated by 3 cysteines
CC  (Cys-X-X-X-Cys-X-X-Cys) and an exchangeable S-adenosyl-L-methionine
CC  molecule. Sulfur is donated by the ThiS-ThiF complex.
