CC  Violacein is a purple bisindole toxin derived from a pair of tryptophan
CC  residues, made by bacteria that include Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC
CC  12472, Janthinobacterium lividum, and Pseudoalteromonas tunicata. The
CC  first two steps are shared with pathways for indolocarbazoles
CC  (rebeccamycin, staurosporine), but action by VioE at the third step
CC  produces protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, rather than allowing the
CC  non-enzymatic conversion to chromopyrrolic acid that occurs during
CC  staurosporine biosynthesis. VioE therefore is a good marker for the
CC  biosynthesis of violacein or closely related compounds. 
**  vioE seems to have no functionally different homologs.
