CC  The reduction of the ribose sugar of ribonucleotide triphosphates to
CC  deoxyribose is one of the essential steps in the biosynthesis of DNA.
CC  This chemically challenging step is carried out be a number of
CC  distinctly different enzyme systems [1]. Each of these systems utilizes
CC  a different mechanism for the generation of a transient cysteine-thiyl
CC  radical which initiates the reduction of the substrate. Class I enzymes
CC  utilize a diferric non-heme iron cluster to generate a stable tyrosine
CC  radical [2]. Note that earlier reports of a manganese-based class IV
CC  system related to class I in high GC gram positive species was proved
CC  to be spurious [3]. Class II enzymes utilize adenosylcobalamin
CC  (vitamin B12) [4]. Class III enzymes utilize radical-SAM domain
CC  proteins to generate stable glycine radicals [5]. A very small
CC  number of genomes appear to be devoid of ribonucleotide reductase
CC  sequences, Mycoplasma arthritidis 158L3-1, Mycoplasma bovis Donetta
CC  PG45, Ureaplasma urealyticum parvum biovar serovar 3, Borrelia
CC  burgdorferi B31 and Borrelia garinii PBi. Each of these is a reduced
CC  genome with a limited metabolic portfolio, however other mycoplasma
CC  species do contain RNRs. Three possibilities are likely, 1) these
CC  genomes harbor a non-orthologous RNR, 2) these genes are located on
CC  plasmids or small chromosomes which were lost prior to genomic
CC  sequencing (Borrelia, in particular has a number of small chromosomes
CC  and plasmids which were sequenced) or 3) these species strictly rely on
CC  import of deoxyribonucleic acid from the host environment.
