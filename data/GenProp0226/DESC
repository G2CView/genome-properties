CC  An integron is a system that enables capture and expression of small
CC  mobile elements called cassettes. Examples that include large numbers
CC  of cassettes, as in Vibrio cholerae El Tor N16961, have been called
CC  super-integron, but it is suggested that this term should be
CC  deprecated, and no distinct property will be built. An integron should
CC  contain an intI gene, of any of several classes, encoding an integrase.
CC  It should have a promoter to drive expression, an attI site, ability to
CC  incorporate cassettes, and multiple attC sites (also called 59-base
CC  element) flanking the cassettes. The attC sites may exhibit high
CC  homology to each other in a long integron, but are best recognized by
CC  imperfect dyad symmetry at their outer ends. A single genome may have
CC  several integrons, and one integron may contain dozens of cassettes.
CC  Note that an integron cassette with a defective integron integrase,
CC  carried by a Tn7 transposon, is called a class 2 integron.
**  A Tn7 system has tnsA, tnsB, tnsC, tnsD, and tnsE genes. The integron
**  integrase with it is likely to have an internal stop codon.
