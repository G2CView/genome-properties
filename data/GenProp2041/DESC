CC  The m-AAA protease complex an ATP-dependent 
CC  metallopeptidase in the mitochondrial membrane which
CC  degrades nonassembled inner membrane proteins.  The
CC  complex is also a chaperone for the assembly of the
CC  the membrane-associated ATP synthase [1].  The 
CC  components of the complex, Yta10p (Afg3p) and Yta12p 
CC  (Rcal1p) are both metallopeptidases with overlapping
CC  specificities.  The complex contains multiple
CC  copies of both proteins [2].  
**  This complex is known only in fungi and the AFG3 homologue 
**  in humans is a pseudogene.  Homologues do exist in other
**  animals including mammals (PTHR43655:SF7).
**  Afg3 is MEROPS identifier M41.002.
**  Rca1 is MEROPS identifier M41.003.
**  PANTHER PTHR43655:SF14 includes both Afg3 and Rca1.
