CC  This Genome Property describes a paralogous system from Acidobacterium
CC  sp. MP5ACTX8. One component is a novel exosortase subtype designated
CC  XrtJ, with a large unique C-terminal region. The other component is its
CC  putative target, consisting of an N-terminal signal sequence ending in
CC  a suggestive GC motif, then a PEP-CTERM-like motif PExP, then a
CC  C-terminal transmembrane domain ending in a basic cluster, all in ~ 62
CC  residues. 
**  The very small size of the PExP motif protein (and the GC at end of
**  signal peptide), and our speculation that XrtJ (and Xrt in general) are
**  transpeptidases makes it tempting to speculate that some part of the
**  PExP protein becomes attached to a different protein.
