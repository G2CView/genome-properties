CC  A nine-gene operon, sbn, encodes genes for staphylobactin biosynthesis
CC  and export. This siderophore, or ferric iron (Fe3+) chelator,
CC  contributes to survival, and therefore virulence, by Staphylococcus
CC  aureus in host tissues. Its reported size by m/z is 822, larger than
CC  staphyloferrins A (480) or B (448). SbnD appears to be the efflux
CC  transporter, SbnI is not homologous to known enzymes, and the other
CC  seven all appear by homology to be enzymes. Mutation of SbnE leads to a
CC  defect in staphylobactin biosynthesis, and an adjacent ABC transporter
CC  system, not currently part of this genome property, takes up ferric
CC  staphylobactin. Note that staphylobactin may be closely to
CC  staphyloferrin B, as all proteins but sbnI have close homologs in
CC  Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000, which is phylogenetically extremely
CC  distant. R. solanacearum, however, makes staphyloferrin B like most
CC  strains of Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus RN6390, meanwhile, appears
CC  to makes staphylobactin in place of staphyloferrin B.
**  Suggestion in PMID:15547261 hints that Dale, et al. are frankly wrong
**  (calls the assertion unexpected) when they say their siderophore
**  differs in weight from staphyloferrin B, which both Ralstonia
**  solanacearum and Staphylococcus aureus make. Looks like Shewanella
**  denitrificans OS217 has the same eight genes.
