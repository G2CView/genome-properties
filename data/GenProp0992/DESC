CC  This system, absolutely restricted to a subset of archaea, always
CC  contains a radical SAM enzyme belonging to the peptide maturase
CC  subclass. A small protein encoded nearby in a couple of cases, 
CC  TIGR04165, is Cys-rich because of two CXXCG motifs, but that
CC  arrangement suggests ligand activity rather than post-translational
CC  modification. 
**  Modification target must not be nearby.
