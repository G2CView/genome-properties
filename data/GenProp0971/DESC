CC  Undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P) is synthesized de novo from farnesyl
CC  diphosphate via eight successive additions of isopentenyl diphosphate
CC  followed by a final removal of one phosphate. Und-P is used as a
CC  carrier for polysaccharide units via a pyrophosphate linkage. Removal
CC  of the polysaccharide results in Und-PP, so the phosphatase is also
CC  used in the recycling back to Und-P.
