CC  Groups of homologous genes may be associated by their proximity and
CC  co-directionality in a number of phylogenetically diverse genomes. A
CC  reasonable hypothesis is that these genes act in a related biological
CC  process. When none of the genes in such a syntenic grouping have a
CC  characterized biological process they may still be used to create a
CC  Genome Property and will be children of this category.
