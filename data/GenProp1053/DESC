CC  In this uncharacterized system, the radical SAM domain protein has a 
CC  Cys-rich suffix domain. In at least eight reference genomes, one Cys 
CC  is replaced by selenocysteine, suggesting enzymatic activity and a 
CC  distinctive role. In a large number of genomes, the radical SAM enzyme 
CC  is co-clustered with a member of family TIGR04169.
**  Version 3 of ProPhylo, 151 genomes, about 7.6 percent of genomes when
**  based on selenoSammy. First couple by PPP were 4 to 5 gene
**  neighborhoods, well-separated, but halves of larger families. Adding
**  two additional families, glycosyltransferases, one like CofC, one like
**  MftF (mycofactocin).
