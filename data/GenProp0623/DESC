RT  Transposon disruption of the complex I NADH oxidoreductase gene
RT  (snoD) in Staphylococcus aureus is associated with reduced
RT  susceptibility to the microbicidal activity of thrombin-induced
RT  platelet microbicidal protein 1.

CC  This gene cluster (snoABCDEFG) has been proposed [1] to encode a
CC  alternative NADH dehydrogenase complex I based on homology to known
CC  complex I subunits and certain knockout phenotype characteristics in
CC  Staphylococcus aureus. The cluster had been previously characterized
CC  as a sodium-proton antiporter.
