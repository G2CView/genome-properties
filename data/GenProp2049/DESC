CC  The CAK complex consists of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), 
CC  cyclin-H (CCNH) and MAT1.  The complex associates with the 
CC  core-TFIIH complex to form the TFIIH basal transcription factor 
CC  [1].  In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CDK7 is known as 
CC  KIN28 and cyclin H is known as CCL1.  Together they form a 
CC  heterodimer known as TFIIK [2].
