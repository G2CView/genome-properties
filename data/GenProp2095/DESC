CC  Insulin is secreted by the pancreatic beta cells. Its
CC  secretion can be stimulated by the import of glucose
CC  via a surface transporter. Metabolism of glucose
CC  increases intracellular ATP, inhibiting ATP-sensitive
CC  potassium channels, causing an influx of calcium into
CC  the cell [1]. Alternatively, there are surface 
CC  receptors for peptide hormones such as glucagon-like 
CC  peptide 1. Binding triggers an increase in cAMP, 
CC  activation of G proteins, leading to insulin secretion
CC  via binding of storage vesicles to the membrane [2].
CC  Depolarization of the plasma membrane leads to an 
CC  influx of calcium, activation of calcium/calmodulin-
CC  dependent protein kinase and translocation of insulin-
CC  containing vesicles to the cell surface [3].
**  Protein kinase A is a tetramer of two catalytic subunits
**  and two regulatory subunits (which bind cAMP).  There
**  are three different human genes encoding a catalytic
**  subunit (alpha, beta and gamma) and four genes that
**  encode regulatory subunits.  The tetramer can be
**  composed of any of these, provided two subunits are
**  catalytic and two regulatory.
