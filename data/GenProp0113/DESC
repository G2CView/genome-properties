CC  Coenzyme B12 (5-Deoxyadenosyl cobalamin) is biosynthesized in
CC  prokaryotes via a complex pathway from uroporphyrinogen III (an
CC  intermediate in the biosynthesis of heme), S-adenosylmethionine,
CC  glutamine, cobalt, glycine, acetyl-CoA, beta-nicotinate mononucleotide
CC  and dimethylbenzimidazole. This property refers to the first section, 
CC  from uroporphyrinogen III to just after colbalt insertion. This version 
CC  of the pathway includes an oxygen-requiring enzyme (CobG) and differs 
CC  from the anaerobic pathway in which the cobalt is inserted early in the
CC  process by an ATP-independent chelatase (CbiK or CbiX). The other
CC  distinctive feature of the aerobic pathway is the C-1 methylase (CobF)
CC  which is replaced by the non-homologous CbiD in the anaerobic process. 
CC  The cobalt(II) reductase which constitutes the final step of
CC  this property is also distinctive for the aerobic path, although the
CC  anaerobic enzyme(s) have not been well studied. The well-characterized 
CC  trimeric ATP-dependent cobaltochelatase (CobNST) is completely detected 
CC  only in a narrow range of prokaryotes. In a number of other species, 
CC  which appear to otherwise utilize the aerobic pathway, CobST is 
CC  apparently replaced with another subunit related to magnesium chelatases 
CC  which we tentatively refer to here as CobX. For this reason, only the 
CC  CobN subunit is relied upon here for the assertion of the YES state. 
CC  Many species exhibit ony one or two of the components distinctive of 
CC  the aerobic pathway (and are either aerobes, microaerophiles or 
CC  facultative anaerobes), possibly indicating non-homologous families 
CC  which are as-of-yet uncharacterized.
