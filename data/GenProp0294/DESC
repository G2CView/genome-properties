CC  Ethanolamine can be broken down to acetaldehyde by the action of
CC  ethanolamine ammonia lyase, an adenosyl cobalamin (vitamin B12)
CC  dependent enzyme. In its simplest form this system consists only of
CC  the two subunits of the enzyme, but ususally also includes a
CC  transporter for ethanolamine and may include a coexpressed acetaldehyde
CC  dehydrogenase to ensure that the toxic aldehyde is efficiently
CC  converted to acetyl-CoA. A more complex version of this system exists
CC  (GenProp0292) which includes additional genes coding for the
CC  proteinaceous coat of a specialized organelle, as well as other genes
CC  for the efficienct maintenance and regulation of the lyase, handling of
CC  the product and import of the substrate. Presumably this organellar
CC  system in organisms which may rely on ethanolamine as a primary carbon
CC  source.
