CC  Biotin-dependent, multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the first
CC  committed step in fatty acid synthesis. The overall reaction is the
CC  biotin-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA. The
CC  first half-reaction catalyzed by biotin carboxylase, is an
CC  ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin, which is covalently attached to
CC  biotin carboxyl carrier protein. The second half-reaction, catalyzed by
CC  carboxyl transferase, transfers the activated carboxyl group from
CC  carboxy-biotin to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA.
