CC  This genome property includes a P-type ATPase copper transporter, a 
CC  copper response regulatory protein and a copper chaperone. Copper is 
CC  a cofactor in some enzymes and is reportedly essential in all living 
CC  organisms, but too much copper can be toxic. A copper response 
CC  operon may include two copper transporters to achieve copper 
CC  homeostatis and include efflux capability. Different copper transport 
CC  systems rely on transporters of other types.
