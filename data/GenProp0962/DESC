RT  A comparison of methanobactins from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and
RT  Methylocystis strain Sb2 predicts methanobactins are synthesized from
RT  diverse peptide precursors modified to create a common core for binding
RT  and reducing copper ions.

CC  Methanobactins are siderophore-like copper chelators. The charter
CC  member for this Genome Property is Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, in
CC  which the methanobactin is made from a 30-residue ribosomally
CC  translated precursor. The only other system known so far is in
CC  Azospirillum sp. B510.
**  Protein families TIGR04039, TIGR04052, and
**  TIGR04061 contain proteins in which the Methylosinus and Azospirillum
**  are mutually the best hits among all genomes, suggesting they act in
**  the methanobactin system.
**  See TIGR04039 plus TIGR04052 = GenProp0940  metallo-mystery pair. See
**  TIGR04061 = AZL_007950_fam.
