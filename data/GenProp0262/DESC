CC  This property describes the bacterial multisubunit DNA-directed RNA
CC  polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6). This property does not include sigma factors
CC  which are regulatory and varied, and so by definition this property
CC  describes the core enzyme rather than the holoenzyme. Subunit
CC  stochiometry is two alpha subunits to one each of beta and beta'. In
CC  Cyanobacteria and plastids, beta' is replaced by two proteins, one like
CC  the N-term of beta' (called gamma in Cyanobacteria and, confusingly,
CC  beta' in plastids) and one like the C-term of beta' (called beta' in
CC  Cyanobacteria and beta'' in plastids)[1].
