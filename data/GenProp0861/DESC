CC  Model TIGR03793 describes a leader peptide region (homologous to the
CC  nitrile hydratase alpha subunit) for peptides subject to modification
CC  by bacteriocin-like maturation enzyme clusters, typically including
CC  either a cyclodehydratase and a dehydrogenase (producing TOMMS -
CC  Thiazole/Oxazole-Modified Microcins) or a lantibiotic synthase. Radical
CC  SAM enzymes are commonly found as well. While sequences of the mature
CC  peptides are highly variable, as are their modification clusters, the
CC  leader peptide region shows a close phylogenetic correlation to a three
CC  gene transporter operon, one subunit of which includes a protease
CC  domain for cleavage at the Gly-Gly motif at the end of the leader
CC  peptide region. This property describes the transport operon as well as
CC  the leader peptide family.
