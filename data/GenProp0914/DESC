RT  Tyrosine, cysteine, and S-adenosyl methionine stimulate in vitro [FeFe]
RT  hydrogenase activation.
RA  Kuchenreuther JM, Stapleton JA, Swartz JR;
RL  PLoS One. 2009;4:e7565.
CC  This system consists of two radical SAM proteins and a GTP-binding
CC  protein involved in [Fe] hydrogenase maturation.
**  Look up HymB (see projects 3488, 3489) for examples of proteins found
**  near FeFe hydrogenase in rare species without hydEFG.
