CC  Role in chromosonal replication. DnaA-ATP-hydrolysis at oriC results in
CC  replication initiation. Hda protein binds to inactive DnaA-ADP thereby
CC  inhibiting multiple events of replication initiation in one replication
CC  cycle. Although Hda can bind DnaA-ATP it has a far greater affinity for
CC  DnaA-ADP. This prevents the DnaA from swapping ADP for ATP prior to the
CC  completion of the current replication cycle.
