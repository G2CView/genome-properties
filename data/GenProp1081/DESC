CC  The bacterial primosome, as in E. coli, restarts replication at sites
CC  away from oriC (where DnaA acts), the normal origin of replication.
CC  PriB is a member of the larger family of single-stranded DNA-binding
CC  (ssb) protein. It is nearly always located between the genes for
CC  ribosomal protein S6 and S18, but appears to be only a subset of such
CC  ssb family members. The ssb member from the same location in most
CC  genomes is longer, and more closely related to a paralog of E. coli
CC  PriB than to PriB itself.
**  Lopper, et al quote: Two distinct replisome loading systems have been
**  biochemically defined, one requiring PriA, PriB, and DnaT, and the
**  other requiring only PriC (Heller and Marians, 2005). DnaT is rare and
**  looks like a RelB addiction module antidote protein.
