CC  This Genome Property represents a pair of families of probable
CC  multi-membrane-spanning enzymes, one with some similarity to
CC  glycosyltransferase family. The sporadic distribution includes a number
CC  of members of the Archaea and the Chloroflexi. The members of the two
CC  families are sometimes clustered, confirming a functional link. The
CC  function is unknown.
