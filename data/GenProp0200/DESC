CC  Denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate via three distinct nitrate
CC  reductase systems. Two of these are assciated with energy-conserving
CC  electron transport systems, distinguished by cellular location and
CC  generation of a proton motive force, and the other with nitrate
CC  assimilation. All three types involve binding of molybdopterin to the
CC  active site of nitrate reductase where reduction occurs. Unlike
CC  membrane-associated nitrate reductases, periplasmic nitrate reductase
CC  cannot itself act as a coupling site for proton translocation, but can
CC  participate indirectly in respiration by virtue of the consumption of
CC  electrons derived from NADH via the proton translocating NADH
CC  dehydrogenase. Expressed aerobically as well as anearobically in
CC  gram-negative bacteria, periplasmic nitrate reductase is a two-subunit
CC  enzyme comprised of a catalytic subunit binding molybdopterin and
CC  containing a twin-arginine signal motif, and a cytochrome subunit,
CC  whose redox partner is a membrane-bound electron transfer protein.
CC  Other essential components for this denitrifying system include a
CC  proposed chaperone, and at least five other components identified in
CC  different combinations in different bacteria [1]. Lacking the
CC  membrane-bound c-type cytochrome component, in Wolinella succinogenes
CC  electron transport to nitrate reductase from one or more of these other
CC  gene products has been demonstrated [2].
**  In E. coli, a 7-gene operon (no NapE). NapGH is required in strains
**  deficient in naphthoquinone synthesis, and in vitro work shows quinol
