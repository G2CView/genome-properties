CC  This enzyme system utilizes three components E1 (thiamine
CC  pyrophosphate-binding subunit, SucA), E2 (dihydrolipoamide
CC  succinyltransferase, SucB) and E3 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase,
CC  LpdA) for the interconversion of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate)
CC  and succinyl-CoA. In addition to lipoate and thiamine pyrophosphate,
CC  FAD is also involved. In the course of the reaction CO2 is released
CC  and one molecule of NAD+ is converted to NADH. This reaction is an
CC  essential component of the TCA (Krebs) cycle [1].
**  Evidence for step 3 is also used for GP0178.
