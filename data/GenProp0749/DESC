CC  This property describes a gene pair for choline sulfate utilization.
CC  Choline is a precursor to the osmoprotectant glycine-betaine and to
CC  acetylcholine, and can be used as an energy source. One member of the
CC  gene pair is a choline-sulfatase, as in Sinorhizobium meliloti and
CC  Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The other gene is both adjacent and a
CC  member of family TIGR03414, periplasmic binding proteins for the ABC
CC  transporters responsible for choline uptake. It appears that several
CC  different periplasmic binding protein interact with the same permease
CC  and ATP-binding subunit.
