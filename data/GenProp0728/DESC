RT  Archaeal type III RuBisCOs function in a pathway for AMP metabolism.
RA  Sato T, Atomi H, Imanaka T;
RL  Science. 2007;315:1003-1006.
CC  Lee, et al. [1] have described an archaeal pathway for the conversion 
CC  of AMP to 3-phosphoglycerate with the release of adenine. This pathway 
CC  includes an AMP phosphorylase previously annotated as a probable 
CC  thymidine phosphorylase, and a ribose-1,5-bisphosphate isomerase 
CC  previously annotated as a translation initation factor.
**  A common feature of these genomes is said to be having an ADP-dependent
