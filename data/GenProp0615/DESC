CC  Mitochondria and many aerobic bacteria utilize cytochrome c as a mobile
CC  electron carrier to couple the processes of oxygen reduction to water
CC  and quinone re-oxidation.  These two processes occur on two separate
CC  complexes, cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome c reductase,
CC  respectively.  Both of these processes als o result in the pumping of
CC  protons across the cell membrane to generate the proton gradient
CC  necessary for ATP generation.
