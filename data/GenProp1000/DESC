RT  acetyltransferase-like domains: synthesis of novel metabolites and
RT  peptide modifications of proteins.

CC  The microviridin family is an example of ribosomally produced, 
CC  post-translationally modified peptides (RiPP) for which the peptide 
CC  maturases come from the ATP-grasp ligase family. This Genome Property 
CC  describes a cassette with a related ATP-grasp enzyme (TIGR04187), a 
CC  putative target family, and a methyltransferase (TIGR04188). We 
CC  propose the name TgmABC (Target/Grasp/Methyltransferase ABC) for the 
CC  system.
