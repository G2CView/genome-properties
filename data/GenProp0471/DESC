CC  This uncharacterized operon may be an addiction module. Both member 
CC  proteins average under 100 amino acids. In one example so far the 
CC  genes are fused. This bacterial gene pair usually but not always 
CC  occurs in prophage or integrated plasmid regions of the genome.
**  The downstream member (TIGR02612) is a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding 
**  protein in the family of PF01381. 
**  Many features like addiction modules. The killer gene ORF was missed
**  initially in a number of genomes: ggs, gac_atcc, ntyp02, and may be
**  point-mutated in gtf.
