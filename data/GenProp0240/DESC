CC  This property describes one of at least five pathways for propionyl-CoA
CC  catabolism in prokaryotes. This pathway requires oxaloacetate and later
CC  releases succinate, both of which are TCA cycle intermediates. TCA
CC  cycle enzymes convert succinate back to oxaloacetate, and so this
CC  pathway is a cycle. Propionyl-CoA may derive from propionate,
CC  propionaldehyde, or other compounds. Propionyl-CoA plus oxaloacetate is
CC  converted by PrpC to 2-methylcitrate, which is then converted in two
CC  steps, by PrpD and an aconitase, to 2-methylisocitrate.
CC  2-methylisocitrate is cleaved by PrpB to pyruvate and succinate. The
CC  TCA cycle enzymes needed to complete the cycle are not modelled here as
CC  part of the pathway
