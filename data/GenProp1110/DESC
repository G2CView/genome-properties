CC  Histone-like DNA-binding complex that is capable of wrapping DNA
CC  forming nucleosome-like structures. May play a role in replication
CC  initiation, transcription, DNA repair (esp. site-specific
CC  recombination) and may protect DNA against UV or gamma radiation. Alpha
CC  knock-out mutants cause uncoordinated replication initiation.
CC  Preferentially binds strongly bent, kinked or distorted DNA such as
CC  that found in damaged DNA. In cooperation with topoisomerase I, the
CC  complex generates negative supercoiling of the bacterial chromosome.
CC  Also binds to DnaA during replication initiation as does the alpha
CC  homodimer (CPX-1959). The alpha/beta heterodimer is predominantly
CC  present during the transition phase, end of exponential phase and
CC  stationary phase.
