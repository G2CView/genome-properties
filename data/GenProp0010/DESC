CC  Inteins are protein insertion sequences that are embedded in host 
CC  protein sequences. They are post-translationally excised from the 
CC  host protein by a self-catalytic protein splicing process, in which 
CC  the intein sequence is precisely excised, and the flanking host 
CC  protein sequences (N- and C-exteins) are re-ligated to create a 
CC  functional protein. The region between the N- and C-terminal splicing 
CC  regions may show endonuclease homology[1].
