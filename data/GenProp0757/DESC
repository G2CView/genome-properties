CC  S-ribosylhomocysteine lyase, 4.4.1.21, is LuxS, an iron(2+)-containing
CC  protein. Its immediate product, 4,5-dihydroxypentan-2,3-dione, cyclizes
CC  spontaneously and binds borate to become autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a
CC  quorum-sensing molecule produced and recognized by a wide range of
CC  bacteria. LuxS serves as a marker for this system, while MTA/SAH
CC  nucleosidase is essential both for this and other systems. Many
CC  clade-specific proteins interact with this system but are not currently
CC  represented as part of this genome property.

**  PMID:16101288. I am also seeing a PTS transporter family role.
