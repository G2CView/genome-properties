CC  Several related molybdopterin-containing enzymes for a distinct class
CC  within the broader set of DMSO reductase family enzymes. The most
CC  distinct feature is the heme b-containing gamma subunit. However, both
CC  the molybdopterin-containing alpha subunit and the iron-sulfur
CC  cluster-containing beta subunit are readily separable by phylogenetic
CC  analysis from multiple sequence alignments. Many of these complexes act
CC  in anaerobic respiration, including a selenate reductase, a chlorate
CC  reductase, and a nitrate reductase.
**  I could require the chaperone by broadening the model and doing
**  HMM-CLUST.
