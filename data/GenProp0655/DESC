CC  At least 30 different bacterial species known so far have the 
CC  PEP-CTERM/exosortase system believed to process proteins analogously to
CC  the LPXTG/sortase system. Genes associated with this processing are
CC  found among exopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes, suggesting that
CC  PEP-CTERM proteins are part of this exopolysaccharide system, and
CC  therefore are likely to be transported across the outer membrane. This
CC  property represents a panel of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes
CC  where each belongs to a subfamily that marks its host gene as  carrying
CC  the PEP-CTERM/exopolysaccharide system. This type 2 version of the
CC  system is found in Methylobacillus sp. strain 12S where it is embedded
CC  in a region for the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide mthanolan.
