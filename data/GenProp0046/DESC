CC  Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is the common intermediate of
CC  isoprenoid metabolism which includes the biosynthesis of terpenoid
CC  natural products, sterols, bile acids, carotenoids, vitamins K and E,
CC  isoprene and other prenylated compounds. IPP may be synthesized via one
CC  of two separate pathways, the mevalonate pathway is typical of
CC  eukaryotes while the deoxyxylulose pathway is typical of prokaryotes.
CC  This property summarizes the states of the two child properties, IPP
CC  biosynthesis via mevalonate and IPP biosynthesis from deoxyxylulose.
