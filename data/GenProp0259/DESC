CC  The tRNA for Asn can be produced in either of two ways: direct
CC  aminoacylation with Asn, and misacylation with Asp that is subsequently
CC  amidated to Asn. This is analogous to the system for charging tRNA with
CC  Gln, and may share some of the same machinery. This property describes
CC  a single polypeptide chain tRNA ligase responsible for direct
CC  aminoacylation with Asn.
