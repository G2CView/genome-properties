CC  Spermine, spermidine and putrescine are a family of polyamines
CC  (positively charged organic polycations) that are important for
CC  cellular growth, most likely by stabilizing polynucleotides and
CC  membranes. Spermidine is derived from putrescine and the
CC  4-aminobutyrate moiety of methionine (indirectly via S-adenosyl
CC  methionine). Spermine is synthesized by a second addition of
CC  4-aminobutyrate to spermidine, and is more commonly found in
CC  eukaryotes.
