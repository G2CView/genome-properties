DE  Coenzyme B12 biosynthesis from cob(II)yrinate diamide
TP  PATHWAY
AU  Haft DH
TH  1
CC  This property covers the main branch of the latter part of the Coenzyme
CC  B12 (5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin) biosynthesis pathway from
CC  cob(II)yrinate diamide, which is the product of cobalt chelatase. 
CC  Additionally, in order to have a complete pathway, an organism must
CC  have the capability to synthesize (or otherwise obtain)
CC  1-amino-2-propanol and alpha-ribazole.
**  Evidence for steps 1 and 4 is the same.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0292.
