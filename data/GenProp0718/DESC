CC  A two-enzyme pathway degrades oxalate, a toxic metabolite. Formyl-CoA
CC  transferase transfers coenzyme A from formyl-CoA to oxalate, leaving
CC  formate. Oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, a TPP-containing enzyme, removes C02
CC  to regenerate formyl-CoA. The net result is conversion of oxalate to
CC  formate and CO2. This system was originally described in Oxalobacter
CC  formigenes from the human gut, and is found in a number of other gut
CC  bacteria.
**  Note that there is some equivocation on the specicity of the E. coli
**  frc entry, YfdW. I guess formyl-CoA is unstable, so reactions on it are
**  tricky to measure, and perhaps the enzyme can also work on related
**  substrates. But the YfdW. crystallographers say it is likely
**  functionally equivalent, and gene neighborhood agrees.
