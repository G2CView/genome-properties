CC  This Genome Property represents a proton-motive cycle. The cycle of
CC  decarboxylating oxalate, a dicarboxylic acid, to formate plus CO2, then
CC  exchanging the cytosolic formate for an extracellular oxalate, has the
CC  net effect of consuming one proton. This property has been studied
CC  extensively in Oxalobacter formigenes, which appears in the human
CC  microbiome and affects oxalate homeostasis.
**  I wonder if there is a direct oxalate decarboxylase form (4.1.1.2).
