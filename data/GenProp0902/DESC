CC  This system is characterized by three subunits of the mature enzyme,
CC  plus one radical SAM protein involved in modification of the gamma
CC  subunit. The gamma subunit contains two unusual modifications. One is a
CC  cysteine tryptophylquinone, which unlike PQQ is derived from the
CC  polypeptide precursor. The other is intrapeptidyl thioether
CC  cross-linking.
**  Note that there are two modifications in the gamma subunit. One is
**  cysteine tryptophylquinone. The other is intrapeptidyl thioether
**  cross-links. Radical SAM may be for the latter.
