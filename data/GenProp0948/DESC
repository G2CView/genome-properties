RT  Bacterial Hen1 is a 3' terminal RNA ribose 2'-O-methyltransferase
RT  component of a bacterial RNA repair cassette.
RA  Jain R, Shuman S;
RL  RNA. 2010;16:316-323.
CC  This property describe the combination of an RNA modification enzyme,
CC  the methyltransferase Hen1, and an RNA repair enzyme, polynucleotide
CC  kinase-phosphatase, as found in model species Clostridium thermocellum
CC  and in many other bacteria in a two-gene cassette. This pairing may
CC  allow RNA cleaved by ribotoxins to be repaired, and to be modified at
CC  the site of repair to prevent the same breakage from occurring again.
