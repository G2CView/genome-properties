CC  This Genome Property is one of many in which a ribosomally translated
CC  peptide is modified post-translationally. Many of the natural products
CC  generated are bacteriocins, although bacteriocin activity cannot be
CC  presumed. An odd feature of this system is the pairing of a radical SAM
CC  enzyme (TIGR04148) with a degenerate radical SAM (pseudo-SAM) protein
CC  (TIGR04150). Despite full-length homology in family TIGR04150, some
CC  members have but others lack the radical SAM signature 4Fe4S-binding
CC  site. However, all members are best conserved at the C terminus, where
CC  the signature motif for the SPASM (Subtilosin, PQQ, Anaearobic 
CC  Sulfatase and Mycofactocin maturases) domain homology 4Fe4S binding
CC  site is invariant. This system occurs, so far, only in the Bacteroidales.
