CC  This system describes a two-enzyme system that at least occasionally
CC  occurs as an enzyme pair. TIGR04036 describes a subset of the
CC  luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM) family with members largely from
CC  species that do not synthesize F420, a cofactor alternative to FMN in
CC  some species. Therefore, the cofactor is likely to FMN itself.
