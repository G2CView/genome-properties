CC  This Genome Property describes a pathway that operates in
CC  butyrate-producing bacteria. A central pathway converts acetyl-CoA to
CC  butyryl-CoA. This Property represents one alternative pathway from
CC  butyryl-CoA to butyrate. The first enzyme, phosphate
CC  butyryltransferase, transfers butyrate from coenzyme A to an inorganic
CC  phosphate. The second enzyme, butyrate kinase, transfers the phosphate
CC  from butryate onto ADP, producing ATP.
**  A different pathway uses butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase.
