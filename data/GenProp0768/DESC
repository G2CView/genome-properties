CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats. Certain proteins are found only in genomes with
CC  CRISPR repeats and are near these repeats. We have shown that certain
CC  families of CRISPR-associated (cas) proteins, unlike the cas1-cas4
CC  genes common to nearly all loci, are relatively uncommon and mark
CC  distinct subclasses of CRISPR/cas system. This Genome Property
CC  describes a rare CRISPR/cas subtype, named Pging for its occurence in
CC  Porphyromonas gingivalis W83.
