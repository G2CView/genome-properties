CC  This Genome Property describes the basic set of bacterial transcription
CC  termination factors. Release factor 1 (RF-1, PrfA) should be both
CC  universal among bacteria and univerally detected, as should release
CC  factor 3 (RF-3). Release factor 2 is a special case. It is truly absent
CC  in the Mycoplasmatales, including Mycoplasma genitalium. Its absence
CC  means TGA is not recognized as a stop coodon. It codes for Trp instead.
CC  However, release factor 2 in most bacteria is encoded by a gene with a
CC  programmed frameshift about 25 amino acids from the N-terminus. It may
CC  be annotated incorrectly as a truncated or disrupted gene and therefore
CC  not detected by its HMM, TIGR00020. A fourth protein included in this
CC  genome property is the ribosome recycling factor, which also partipates
CC  in processes at the conclusion of bacterial protein translation. This
CC  property does not include PrfH, part of a specialized system present
CC  only in some bacteria, as it is intended for essentially univeral
CC  bacterial termination factors.
**  TIGR03534 (HemK) was made from only members encoded next to prfA, yet
**  (because of paralog PrmB) does not even detect all members of the seed.
**  Therefore, a rule based on HMM-CLUST will be necessary.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0799.
**  Evidence for step 5 is also used for GP0799.
