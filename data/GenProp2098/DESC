DC  Insulin secretion
DR  KEGG; map04911;
CC  Insulin is secreted by the pancreatic beta cells. Its
CC  secretion can be stimulated by the import of glucose
CC  via a surface transporter, and metabolism of glucose
CC  increases intracellular ATP, inhibiting ATP-sensitive
CC  potassium channels, causing an influx of calcium into
CC  the cell [1].  Alternatively, there are surface 
CC  receptors for acetylcholine, CCK and FA.  Binding 
CC  leads to activation of PLC, which generates the second 
CC  messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) [2].  The 
CC  binding of IP3 to a receptor of the endoplasmic 
CC  reticulum surface, leads to calcium release into the
CC  cyoplasm and activation of CAMK.  This leads to release
CC  of insulin from insulin secretory granules.
**  The KEGG pathway shows release of calcium via the ER by
**  ryanodine receptor 2, but the SwissProt entry describes
**  this receptor as restricted to cardiac muscle, not
**  pancreatic beta cells.
