CC  Catalyses the transfer of the threonylcarbamoyl-moiety of
CC  threonylcarbamoyladenylate onto A37 of substrate tRNA in the cytoplasm,
CC  or more probably in E.coli, the formation of 'cyclic t6A' (ct6A), which
CC  is a cyclized active ester with an oxazolone ring. The
CC  N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) modification is present at position
CC  37 of tRNAs that recognize ANN-codons, with N being any nucleotide,
CC  enhancing the codon-anti-codon interaction and is required for
CC  recognition of the AUG start codon. The modification is thus important
CC  for maintaining translational fidelity. A stable YgjD-YeaZ heterodimer
CC  first forms, which has an atypical ADP-binding site at the YgjD-YeaZ
CC  interface that may also be the binding site for YjeE as the ternary
CC  complex only forms in the presence of ATP. An additional YrdC protein
CC  is necessary for T6a activity.
