CC  Acetate and acetyl-CoA can be interconverted by any of several routes.
CC  This pathway utilizes acetyl phosphate as an intermediate. This system
CC  is used in E. coli and other bacteria for the utilization of acetate as
CC  a carbon source [1].  Alternatively, the reactions may be run in the
CC  catabolic direction in fermentations in order to produce ATP and
CC  excrete acetate.  
**  Detection of the phosphate acetyltransferase is via a
**  TIGRFAMs equivalog in some cases, while in others the discrimination
**  between substrate specificities for acetate and butyrate (PF01515) is
**  unclear.  In the absence of an equivalog hit, when a gene adjacent to
**  the kinase and in an apparent operon and hits the PFAM subfamily and
**  the genomic context does not otherwise indicate the handling of
**  butyrate, the gene will be manually included.  A member of PF01515
**  which is distal from the acetate kinase in Thermotoga has been
**  experimentally characterized [3] and has also been manually included.
