CC  This property describes 5,10-methenyltetrahydromethanopterin
CC  hydrogenase (HmdA), also called mono-iron hydrogenase or iron-sulfur
CC  cluster-free hydrogenase, together with a few of its accessory
CC  proteins: HmdB (a radical SAM protein) and HmdC. The enzyme contains a
CC  novel cofactor with an Fe ion ligated by two CO molecules, a cysteine
CC  side chain, a guanylyl pyridinol cofactor, and an uncharacterized
CC  additional ligand.
**  So the list of accessory proteins is probably way-incomplete! And HmdC
**  shows up in ntmh06 without the other two.
