CC  This property describes the common subtype of the sortase system for
CC  targeting cell wall proteins in the Firmicutes by recognition of the
CC  LPXTG C-terminal motif. The presence of one or more sortases and their
CC  target sequences should be universal in Gram-positive organisms with
CC  cell walls. Sortase is a transpeptidase; sortases belonging to this
CC  Genome Property resemble SrtA, and the sorting signal generally
CC  resembles LPXTG. Several SrtA paralogs can be found in some genomes, as
CC  well as the substantially different SrtB and other families of sortase
CC  and their cognate sequences.
**  There are LPXTG variants/ SrtA sortases. 60390 - GenProp0664 is sortase
**  system, SrtB class.
