CC  This property describes a gene pair for choline sulfate utilization.
CC  Choline is a precursor to the osmoprotectant glycine-betaine and to
CC  acetylcholine, and can be used as an energy source. One member of the
CC  gene pair is a choline-sulfatase, as in Sinorhizobium meliloti and
CC  Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The other gene is a periplasmic binding 
CC  protein for the ABC transporters responsible for choline uptake. It 
CC  appears that several different periplasmic binding proteins interact 
CC  with the same permease and ATP-binding subunit.
