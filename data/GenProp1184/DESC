CC  Inactive form of the sigma-E transcription factor. Sigma-E-mediated
CC  envelope stress response is the major pathway to ensure homeostasis in
CC  the envelope compartment of the cell. In response to stress, outer
CC  membrane proteins accumulate in the periplasm and activate cleavage of
CC  RseA periplasmic domain by DegS (P0AEE3), triggering a proteolytic
CC  cascade that frees sigma-E to activate gene expression. RseB binding to
CC  RseA prevents activated DegS from cleaving RseA.
