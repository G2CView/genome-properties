CC  The cytochrome bd complex is a quinol oxidase, oxygen reductase.
CC  Usually this complex functions to couple the reduced quinone pool to
CC  the oxygen terminal electron acceptor in aerobic respiration. It has
CC  been reported that certain anaerobes or microaerophiles may utilize
CC  this system to reduce the amount of oxygen present in their local
CC  environment [1]. The complex is composed of two subunits: Subunit I
CC  (CydA) contains the quinone binding site [2] and is also a component of
CC  the cytochrome b0 complex.  Subunit II (CydB) contains the binding site
CC  for heme b558.  Additionally, the complex contains two other hemes,
CC  b595 and d which make up the oxygen reduction site [3].
