CC  MutM excises 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) that has formed in DNA and that has 
CC  not since replicated (meaning it should be paired with C). If 
CC  replication allows 8-oxoG to mispair with A, MutY excises the A to allow
CC  replication repair to replace it with a C. Note that MutT performs a
CC  different process, hydrolyzing 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGMP to block its
CC  incorporation into DNA in the first place, and therefore does perform
CC  DNA repair per se.
