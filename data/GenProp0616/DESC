CC  Many aerobic bacteria have complexes for the reduction of oxygen that
CC  are independent of cytochrome c (as found in mitochondria). These
CC  complexes carry out the conversion of oxygen to water, the oxidation of
CC  reduced quinones and the pumping of protons to generate the proton
CC  gradient for ATP generateion. Examples include the cytochrome bd
CC  complex and the cytochrome bo complex.
