CC  GroEL and GroES comprise the bacterial group I chaperonin, a toroidal
CC  complex involved in folding or refolding proteins in the cytosol[1].
CC  Archaea and Eukaryotes have instead (with a few rare cases of overlap)
CC  a group II chaperonin complex, usually called the thermosome in the
CC  Archaea and CCT in the Eukaryota. At least one member of the archaeal
CC  genus Methanosarcina, has both[2].
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0800 (GUILD).
