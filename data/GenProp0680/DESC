CC  This property is system II for c-type cytochrome biosynthesis, one
CC  among three such systems described, and one of two described in
CC  bacteria. The two genes critical even in the presence of the added
CC  disulfide bond reducing compounds, are CcsA (or ResB) and CcsB (or
CC  ResC). This system is much simpler than the CcmABCDEFGH system, system
CC  I.
