CC  Potassium efflux pore which protects the bacteria from the toxic
CC  effects of electrophilic compounds that react with nucleophiles found
CC  in the bases of DNA and the side chains of proteins, especially
CC  cysteine. Potassium efflux via KefB is accompanied by H+ and Na+ influx
CC  and hence causes acidification of the cytoplasm. KefB is activated by
CC  glutathione adducts and inactivated by glutathione which bind to the
CC  cytosolic regulatory K+ transport and nucleotide binding domain of
CC  KefB.
