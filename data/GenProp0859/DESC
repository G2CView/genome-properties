CC  This property represents a specialization of SrtA-like sortase systems
CC  in the Proteobacteria, including many marine species. In contrast to
CC  sortase A systems in the Firmicutes, where a single transpeptidase
CC  serves multiple target proteins, this system is characterized by a
CC  single sorting target protein, conserved across species, adjacent to
CC  the sorting enzyme itself. In a majority of species with this system,
CC  the sortase and target pair are accompanied by a histidine kinase and
CC  response regulator pair.
