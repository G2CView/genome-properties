CC  Biotin is an essential cofactor for many carboxylation (addition of
CC  CO2) reactions. This property reflects biosynthesis of biotin from 
CC  pimeloyl-CoA, although the source of pimeloyl-CoA may vary.
CC  8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (also called 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic
CC  acid synthetase, AONS, gene BioF) converts pimeloyl-CoA to 
CC  8-amino-7-oxononanoate (AON). Adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate
CC  aminotransferase (gene BioA) converts the product to 
CC  7,8-diaminononanoate, from which dethiobiotin synthase (gene BioD) 
CC  makes dethiobiotin. Biotin synthase (gene BioB) then makes biotin 
CC  itself[1]. Enzymes such as carboxylesterase (gene BioH), which are 
CC  involved in pimeloyl-CoA biosynthesis typically receive biotin-related 
CC  annotations, but may also appear in genomes in which biotin is not 
CC  synthesized and pimeloyl-CoA is used for something else.
**  Enzymes involved in the production of pimeloyl-CoA may be designated
**  bio(x) in some species, but pimelate does not necessarily lead to
**  biotin.
**  Evidence for step 7 is also used for GP1094.
