CC  Type II DNA topoisomerase responsible for relaxing supercoiled DNA by
CC  introducing a double-stranded break in DNA and passing a second duplex
CC  segment of DNA through the break before resealing it. Acts on
CC  topologically different substrates including (+) and negative (-)
CC  supercoiled DNA and knotted and catenated DNA. Decatenates newly
CC  replicated DNA, removing the majority of links behind the replication
CC  forks.
