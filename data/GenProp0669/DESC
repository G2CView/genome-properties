CC  For several non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, a protein family
CC  showing considerable sequence similarity to the proposed exosortases 
CC  of Gram-negative bacteria occurs in a conserved gene neighborhood. 
CC  This property describes that neighborhood, which also includes a 
CC  glycosyltransferase and a domain related to 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin 
CC  synthases. These regions also include a family of proteins in the which 
CC  the well-conserved C-terminal region (TIGR04145) resembles PEP-CTERM and
CC  LPXTG protein C-terminal regions. This last family may be the
CC  protein-sorting target.
**  Experimental for now, PEP-CTERM/Exosortase-related. The model TIGR03766
**  was built to add to this property, next to the region in at least three
**  genomes, but phylogenetic match is highly imperfect. Also, the
**  conserved motif at the tail end of TIGR03766 is much much broader, and
**  also a disappointment in phylogenetic profile explorations (iso_id
**  27433).
