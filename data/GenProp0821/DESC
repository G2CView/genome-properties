CC  This Genome Property describes an unusual two-gene cassette for a
CC  probable transporter system. The longer protein belongs to the
CC  sodium:solute symporter family. The shorter, found almost invariably
CC  immediately upstream, is highly hydrophobic but uncharacterized. The
CC  pair is found in about one in six completed prokaryotic genomes.
**  The two HMMs are both broad enough that the pair should represent a
**  type of transporter, and multiple substrates.
