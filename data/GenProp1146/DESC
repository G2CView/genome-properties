CC  Catalyses the phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone (Dha) using
CC  phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a phosphoryl donor. Dihydroxyacetone
CC  phosphate (Dha-P) is an intermediate for the synthesis of pyruvate. The
CC  E1 domain of DhaM catalyses the phosphoryl transfer from PEP to the
CC  small (9 kDa) soluble HPr (histidine-containing phosphoryl carrier
CC  protein) domain. Phosphorylated DhaM binds to ADP-bound DhaL and
CC  transiently phosphorylates the ADP. ATP-loaded DhaL associates with
CC  DhaK containing the Dha substrate covalently bound to His-218 through a
CC  hemiaminal bond. Coenzyme, ATP-bound DhaL transfers a phosphate to Dha
CC  yielding Dha-P.
