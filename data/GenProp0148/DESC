RT  Does disparate occurrence of autoregulatory programmed frameshifting in
RT  decoding the release factor 2 gene reflect an ancient origin with loss
RT  in independent lineages?

CC  Peptide chain release factor 2, product of the prfB gene (RF2, or
CC  PrfB), often has a programmed frameshift. When enough RF2 is present,
CC  translation ends at a UGA (amber) stop codon soon after the start.
CC  Without sufficient RF2, a translational frameshift occurs, allowing RF2
CC  to be made. UGA codons also play a role in selenocysteine
CC  incorporation, but the programmed frameshift in the prfB gene appears
CC  much more widespread than selenocysteine incorporation.
