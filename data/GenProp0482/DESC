CC  6S RNA is a structural RNA widely distributed in bacteria. It is
CC  considered non-coding, but in many Proteobacteria such as Escherichia
CC  coli its ssrS gene is cotranscribed with ygfA, a putative
CC  methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase gene found immediately downstream.
CC  6S RNA functions by binding to the sigma-70 RNA polymerase holoenzyme
CC  during stationary phase and suppressing transcription from a subset of
CC  sigma-70-dependent promoters. In alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria, the
CC  ygfA gene, encoding a putative methylenetetrahydrofolate synthetase,
CC  regularly is found immediately downstream of ssrS in a conserved
CC  operon. While the meaning of this association is unclear, other than
CC  coordination in gene expression, ygfA is included as an optional
CC  element for this genome property.
**  The endpoints of our prediction for the 6S RNA gene will be taken as
**  the extent of the gene. Also, a decision is PENDING on whether a 6S
**  will count if, as in Bacillus, it is a second 6S and has inverse
**  regulation.  WE NEED to update property, then DO PARTIAL PHYLOGENETIC
**  PROFILING. DHH.
