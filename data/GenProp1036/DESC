CC  The E. coli O11 antigen (which is identical to the S. enterica O16
CC  antigen) consists of a branched pentasaccharide with the structure
CC  [->4)aDGalNAc{(3<-1)aLFuc}(1->6)aDMan(1->3)aLFuc(1->3)bDGalNAc(1->].
CC  The paper reporting the structure of the antigen [1] also reported a
CC  separate disaccharide of unknown provenance. Subsequent genome
CC  sequencing of an O11 strain found no evidence of the machinery required
CC  to synthesize the reported sugars, so it would appear at the very least
CC  to have nothing to do with O11. The four glycosyltransferases WdaDEFG
CC  correspond to the four glycosidic linkages in the antigen monomer. WdaG
CC  shows a high similarity (>95% identity) to enzymes of uncharacterized
CC  specificity from the E. coli O125 and O41 antigens. The structure of
CC  O41(Ec) is undetermined, but O125(Ec) shares a very similar
CC  trisaccharide structure at the end of the monomer with O11(Ec)
CC  containing the linkages: [aDMan(1->3)LFuc], and [aLFuc(1->3)DGalNAc].
CC  O11(Ec) also contains a second [aLFuc(1-3)DGalNAc] linkage, but at the
CC  branching linkage. Interestingly, WdaD is most similar to the same set
CC  of homologs as WdaG, but only at around 35% identity, consistent with
CC  it being responsible for the branching linkage. WdaF is similar (~29%
CC  identity) to some mannose mannosyltransferases and thus may be
CC  responsible for the [aDGalNAc(1->6)DMan] transfer. Based on these three
CC  assignments, WdaE can be assigned the final activity [DMan(1->3)aLFuc]
CC  by process of elimination. WdaE also has the lowest degree of
CC  similarity to other glycosyltransferases and is consistent with
CC  L-fucose being quite rare in known E. coil O-antigen structures.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0143, GP1031 and GP1035.
