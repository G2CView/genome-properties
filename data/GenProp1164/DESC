CC  A protein complex integral to the bacterial electron transport chain.
CC  Electrons are donated by the oxidation of ubiquinol to ubiquinone,
CC  transferred to a slow-spinning heme b and subsequently accepted by a
CC  binuclear centre consisting of a heme o3 and a copper ion. In the
CC  process, the ubiquinol oxidase functions as a proton pump creating a
CC  transmembrane electrochemical gradient as 4 hydrogen ions are pumped
CC  through the membrane into the periplasmic space while 1/2 O2 molecule
CC  is oxidized to water. The electron transport happens exclusively in
CC  subunit I (cyoB). Ubiquinol oxidase is the final electron acceptor in
CC  the bacterial respiratory chain and thought to possess one of the most
CC  important functions in the cellular system due to its anti-oxidant
CC  properties.
