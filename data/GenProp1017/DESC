CC  GDP-D-mannose is used as a source of mannose when coupled with the gmm
CC  enzyme, as a source of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose when coupled with the 
CC  gmd enzyme (and then subsequently used to make fucose, perosamine and 
CC  colicin and their derivatives). GDP-mannose may also be incorporated 
CC  directly into polysaccharides such as the E. coli O8 and O9 antigens 
CC  and the Klebsiella O5 antigen. The pathway consists of three acivities, 
CC  an isomerase, a phosphomutase and a guanylyl transferase. The first and 
CC  last steps are often catalyzed by a fusion protein (ManAC).
