CC  Methionine, free or in proteins, is susceptible to oxidation damage. R-
CC  and S-conformation enantiomers of methionine sulfoxide can be repaired
CC  by different reductases. MsrB (TIGR00357) was previously designated
CC  PilB because of altered cytoadherence in a mutant. MsrA and MsrB are
CC  sometimes expressed as a fusion protein.
**  different enzymes/domains for different oxidized forms
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used in GP0213.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used in GP0182.
