CC  Aah and TibC are protein O-heptosyltransferases that glycosylate
CC  certain repeat-rich proteins at multiple sites. Their targets are the
CC  autotransporter (T5SS) proteins AIDA (autotransporter adhesin involved
CC  in diffuse adherence) and TibA, respectively. Similar tandem gene pairs
CC  occur in Burkholderia vietnamiensis G4, Granulibacter bethesdensis
CC  CGDNIH1, Cronobacter sakazakii ATCC BAA-894, and Bradyrhizobium sp.
CC  ORS278. In Burkholderia mallei, the heptosyltransferase occurs next to
CC  BimA, an autotransporter virulence factor involved in actin-based
CC  motility, suggesting glycosylation, although BimA lacks the repeat
CC  structure recognized by model TIGR04415.
**  BMA_A0749, BimA, is in right context but TIGR04415 does not hit it.
