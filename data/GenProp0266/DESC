CC  Trehalose is an alpha,alpha glucose disaccharide that serves as a
CC  highly protective osmoprotectant in many species in all three domains
CC  of life. Trehalose may also be a component of more complex molecules
CC  such as cell wall glycolipids in Actinomycetes. The TreYZ is one of
CC  several pathways for trehalose biosynthesis and is dependent on the
CC  presence of glycogen-like glucose polymers. It is alternative to the
CC  OtsAB (osmotically regulated trehalose synthesis A and B) system. In
CC  some species with both, the TreYZ rather then the OtsAB system is
CC  induced by osmotic stress.
