CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. Jansen, et al. describe CRISPR loci as
CC  having direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by
CC  similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. Variants of CRISP/Cas loci
CC  (subtypes) have been described (Haft, Selengut, et al., submitted) in
CC  which certain groups of subtype-specific genes are found in addition to
CC  characteristic sets of the more widely distributed cas genes. The Ecoli
CC  subtype, so named because this subtype is the only one found in the
CC  genome of Escherichia coli, consists of cas1-3, a subtype-specific
CC  variant of cas5 and the subtype specific genes cse1-4. The repeats
CC  associated with this subtype tend to have a periodicity of 61
CC  nucleotides and a repeat size of 29 mucleotides. This subtype is found
CC  in a wide variety of bacteria and has also been reported to be present
CC  in an archaeon [2].
