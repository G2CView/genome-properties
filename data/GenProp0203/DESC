CC  Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) occurs broadly in Gram-negative bacterial
CC  outer membrane. Three parts are termed lipid A, the oligosaccharide
CC  core, and O antigen [1]. If lacking the repeating O-antigen, it may be
CC  termed Lipooligosaccharide (LOS). The core is often described as having
CC  inner and outer regions, and is variable among species that contain
CC  LPS/LOS. This property describes a widely distributed common chemistry
CC  for the inner core. At least two residues of
CC  3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) are present, one of which has
CC  the lipid A moeity is attached. The inner core in E. coli and many
CC  other bacteria also contains at least two heptose residues, added by
CC  distinct heptosyltransferases I and II.
**  kbl is in theater but not part of property.  KdsA (KDO-8-phosphate
**  synthase) helps make Kdo, in Moraxella catarrhalis from
**  arabinose-5-phosphate and PEP. In operon pyrG-kdsA-eno, PyrG is a CTP
**  synthase, eno make PEP.
