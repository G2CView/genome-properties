CC  The sugar intermediate GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose is produced in a
CC  4-step pathway from beta-D-fructose-6-phosphate using the ManABC and
CC  Gmd gene products.  Mannose may be produced as a side-product of this
CC  pathway by the inclusion of the Gmm gene product (GDP-mannose mannosyl
CC  hydrolase).  GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose may be converted to GDP-L-fucose
CC  by the Fcl gene product, to perosamine by Per, or to colicin by ColCD.
