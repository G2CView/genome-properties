CC  Member of the chaperonin class of molecular chaperones required for the
CC  ATP-driven assisted folding of many proteins. Direct contact between
CC  substrate proteins and the C-terminal tails of the GroEL subunits helps
CC  prevent premature substrate protein escape during encapsulation.
CC  Encapsulation seals the GroEL cavity and results in the release of the
CC  substrate protein into an enlarged GroEL-GroES chamber. Protein folding
CC  is initiated by a conformational shift within the GroEL-GroES complex.
CC  Hydrolysis of ATP and binding of a new substrate protein to the
CC  opposite cavity sends an allosteric signal causing GroES and the
CC  encapsulated protein to be released into the cytosol.
