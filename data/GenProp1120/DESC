CC  Toxin-antitoxin (TA) complex. TA systems act as effectors of dormancy
CC  and persistence and are composed of a toxin, which causes growth arrest
CC  by interfering with a vital cellular process, and a cognate antitoxin,
CC  which neutralizes the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. 
CC  Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded,
CC  leaving the toxins to exert their toxic effects, leading to growth
CC  arrest and dormancy. Type II TA complexes are small protein-protein
CC  pairs; under growth conditions, the toxin is bound to the antitoxin,
CC  which inhibits its activity. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the
CC  TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription. Under stress
CC  conditions, cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP
CC  (CPX-3176) are activated that preferentially cleave the antitoxins,
CC  freeing the toxins to inhibit growth by inhibiting translation or
CC  replication, enabling cells to enter a metabolically dormant state
CC  until the stress is removed. Complex formation prevents the protein
CC  kinase HipA acting as a persistence factor, inducing multi-drug
CC  tolerance by triggering growth arrest. HipA activity is inhibited upon
CC  binding to HipB through sequestration to the nucleoid and binding to
CC  DNA. HipB and HipAB act as transcriptional autoregulators of the
CC  hipBA operon.
