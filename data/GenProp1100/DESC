CC  This property describes gene pairs with a member of family PF07505 and
CC  a member of family TIGR04474. Both proteins appear to be enzymes, based
CC  on motif-like patterns of sequence conservation. Genomic contexts include
CC  phage contexts but other contexts as well, such as between recAX and
CC  miaB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
**  The protein name assigned by PF07505, phage protein Gp37Gp68, is probably 
**  misleading in most cases.
**  Some stats: of 145 genomes with TIGR04474, one fusion and 102 have
**  PF07505 adjacent. In other direction, maybe fewer.
