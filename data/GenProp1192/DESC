CC  Scaffold complex that assembles an Fe-S cluster. The SufB protomer of
CC  the SufBCD complex accepts the atomic sulfur from the sulfur transfer
CC  protein SufE (CPX-2125 [SufE dimer], EBI-8844754 [transfer
CC  interaction]) and incorporates it into an [4Fe-4S] cluster in an as yet
CC  undiscovered manner. SufBCD further transfers the Fe-S cluster to the
CC  carrier protein SufA (CPX-2142 [dimer], EBI-8805910 [transfer
CC  interaction]). SufBCD is a component of the sufABCDSE operon, which is
CC  activated and required under specific conditions such as oxidative
CC  stress and iron limitation. The SufBCD complex is a putative ATP-binding
CC  cassette (ABC) transporter complex, inferred by its structural
CC  similarity with other ABC transporters. SufC has been shown to be an
CC  ATPase whose activity is enhanced by the presence of SufB and SufD [1].
CC  The precise function of FADH2 is not yet clear. Under aerobic conditions 
CC  FADH2 is oxidised to FAD and dissociates from SufBCD.
