CC  Complement is a ring-shaped complex that forms pores in bacterial 
CC  cell membranes, making the cells leak and thus kill invading bacteria
CC  and other pathogens. There are three pathways by which complement is 
CC  activated, known as the classical, alternative and lectin pathways.
CC  Activation involves proteolytic cascades which are different for each
CC  of the activation pathways.  The classical and lectin pathways converge
CC  at the activation of the C2/C4 complex, whereas the alternative pathway
CC  converges at C5 activation [1].  The pathways are found only in 
CC  chordates.
