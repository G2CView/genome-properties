CC  Functions as the leading- and lagging-strand replicase in DNA
CC  replication. Pol III alone exhibits a very low processivity, additional
CC  interactions stabilize the interaction of Pol III with the replication
CC  fork and increase its processivity. The polymerase subunit of the DNA
CC  polymerase III holoenzyme (CPX-1924) contains three participants: the
CC  polymerase subunit alpha and the two proofreading subunits, epsilon and
CC  theta. While two polymerase subcomplexes elongate the leading and
CC  lagging strands the function of the third polymerase subcomplex - bound
CC  to the third tau subunit of the clamp loading complex (CPX-1926) - is
CC  as of yet unknown. The beta and tau subunits of the Pol III holoenzyme
CC  appear to be competing for the same binding site on alpha. This
CC  competition allows for the clamp loader (CPX-1926) to disengage from
CC  the polymerase unit and facilitate binding of alpha to the sliding
CC  clamp (CPX-1927) to commence strand elongation. At the end of
CC  replication the tau subunit re-connects with alpha, displacing the
CC  polymerase subcomplex from the newly-synthesised double-stranded DNA.
