CC  2,3-dihydroxybenzoate is made in three steps from chorismate by the
CC  action of enzymes isochorismate synthase (EC 5.4.4.2), isochorismatase 
CC  (EC 3.3.2.1), and 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase 
CC  (EC 1.3.1.28). It can then be activated by (2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)adenylate 
CC  synthase (EC 2.7.7.58) to become a substrate for nonribosomal peptide 
CC  synthases (NRPS) such as those that make catecholate siderophores.
**  Evidence for step 3 is also used for GP0058.
