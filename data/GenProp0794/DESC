CC  The WbuX protein from E. coli and its homologs in P. aeruginosa (IfnA)
CC  and C. jejuni (PseA) have been proposed to function as N-acetyl sugar
CC  amidotransferases, forming the positively charged acetamidino moitey on
CC  both O-antigens and glycosylated flagellins [1,2]. These WbuX homologs
CC  are invariably associated with homologs of the HisH and HisF proteins
CC  (WbuYZ) which are proposed to act as a glutaminase and ammonium channel,
CC  to provide sufficient ammonium ion under limiting conditions [3]. 
CC  Occasionally the WbuX protein is found in multiple (tandem) copies
CC  which may indicate multiple substrates or multiple N-acetyl groups
CC  being modified on the same substrate.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0796 and GP0912 (GUILD).
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0109 and GP0912 (GUILD).
