RT  The unrelated surface proteins ActA of Listeria monocytogenes and IcsA
RT  of Shigella flexneri are sufficient to confer actin-based motility on
RT  Listeria innocua and Escherichia coli respectively.

CC  Actin-based motility is the process by which a bacterial pathogen uses
CC  host cell actin dynamics to achieve movement within or between cells.
CC  Bacteria known to have this capacity include Mycobacterium marinum,
CC  Burkholderia pseudomallei, and and Listeria, Rickettsia, and Shigella
CC  species. Proteins responsible for actin-dependent movement in different
CC  species share actin-binding function but may have no sequence homology
CC  from one to another.
**  Beware the incompleteness of signatures for detecting. Listeria ActA is
**  PF05058. Have ActA, IcsA, BimA, but not the one from Mycobacterium
**  marinum. DHH.
