CC  Tetrahydromethanopterin, or H4MPT, is a chemical analog of
CC  tetrahydrofolate, or H4F. It acts as a C-1 carrier for interconversions
CC  of formate, formaldehyde, and methanol, and was once thought to occur
CC  only in methanogenic archaea.
**  Note the existence of the tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) derivative
**  dephospho-H4MPT as a C1 carrier in addition (in ntme01).
