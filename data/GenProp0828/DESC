CC  This system is found in certain lineages of the Bacillus/Clostridium
CC  group, including a number of pathogenic species. In order to obtain
CC  iron, this system utilizes a number of NEAT domain containing proteins 
CC  to scavenge heme from host hemoproteins and convey them across the 
CC  cell wall to an ABC transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane. Cell
CC  wall localization of these components is generally mediated by
CC  sortases, SrtB being particularly critical to this system in many
CC  organisms. Heme is often oxidized to biliverdin by heme oxygenases in
CC  the cytoplasm, releasing iron.  Genes of this system are generally
CC  given "isd" gene symbols where isd stands for Iron-regulated Surface
CC  Determinant proteins. 
**  Redundant property 66552 was created, no steps, but this comment:
**  Bacillus anthracis and related bacilli has the ability to remove heme
**  from hemoglobin, import the heme and utilize the iron. This process is
**  encoded by the isd locus. This locus includes sortase B (SrtB) which
**  functions to localize the IsdC protein to the cell wall peptidoglycan.
**  IsdC is a NEAT domain protein (PF05031) as are IsdX1 and IsdX2. The
**  NEAT domain is proposed to be involved in iron-siderophore transport
**  processes and is likely to mediate heme binding in this system. IsdX1
**  and IsdX2 are secreted proteins which have the ability to remove heme
**  from hemoglobin, apparently by a direct hemoglobin binding mechanism
**  (as opposed to by virtue of a tighter binding of heme). IsdE-IsdE2-IsdF
**  are an ABC membrane transporter complex, presumably transporting heme
**  into the cell. Finally, IsdG is a cytoplasmic monooxygenase involved in
**  the cleavahe of the heme ring and the liberation of iron.
