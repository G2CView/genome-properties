CC  This pathway for the biosynthesis of L-lysine differs from the more
CC  common diaminopimelate pathway by the action of diaminopimelate
CC  dehydrogenase (ddh). This enzyme requires both ammonia as a nitrogen
CC  source (instead of an amino acid via a transaminase) and reductive
CC  power in the form of NADPH. Additionally, this pathway does not require
CC  the acetyl/succinyl protecting group transformations found in the
CC  standard pathway, nor does it require the action of diaminopimelate
CC  epimerase. This enzyme has been best characterized in Corynebacterium
CC  glutamicum and Bacillus sphaericus. One should note that the ddh
CC  enzyme is shown acting on the compound L-2-amino-6-oxoheptanedioate in
CC  EC and KEGG representations. This is merely the ring-opened form of
CC  2,3,4,5-tetrahydropicolinate with which it is in equilibrium, and upon
CC  which the acyltransferases of the common pathway act.
**  Threshhold is set at 4 so that genomes only lacking ddh will still show
**  up as not supported.  Consequently, genomes with ddh and lacking one of
**  the other pieces must be manually toggled to some evidence with the
**  curators assignby.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0125.
