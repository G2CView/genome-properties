CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. Jansen, et al. describe CRISPR loci as
CC  having direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by
CC  similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. Variants of CRISP/Cas loci
CC  (subtypes) have been described [2] in which certain groups of 
CC  subtype-specific genes are found in addition to characteristic sets of 
CC  the more widely distributed cas genes. The Tneap subtype, so named 
CC  because this subtype is the only one found in the genome of Thermotoga 
CC  neapolitana DSM4359, consists of cas1-5 and the subtype specific genes 
CC  cst1-2. The repeats associated with this subtype tend to have a 
CC  periodicity of 66 nucleotides. This subtype is found both in Archaea and 
CC  Bacteria (with the notable exclusion of the Proteobacteria).
