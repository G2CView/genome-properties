CC  Plays a role in chemotaxis, the movement toward or away from chemicals.
CC  The complex is formed to activate CheY protein that then induces the
CC  change of the flagellar rotors from counterclocwise to clockwise
CC  rotation. CheA interacts with transmembrane chemoreceptors to generate
CC  stimulus signals via autophosphorylion of CheA which then serves as a
CC  phosphodonor for CheY. The P-CheY generated by this interaction binds
CC  to FliM (P06974), the switch component of the flagellar motor.
