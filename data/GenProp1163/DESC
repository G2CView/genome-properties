CC  Involved in the sulfur transfer during iron-sulfur cluster assembly and
CC  in the modification of tRNA wobble positions. IscS desulfurases
CC  L-cysteine and transfers sulfur on IscU while the latter is in the
CC  D-state, a partly disordered state that contains an ordered domain that
CC  stabilizes two cis peptidyl-prolyl peptide bonds. After Fe-S cluster
CC  formation on IscU, IscU converts to the S-state, which has a lower
CC  affinity for IscS and minimizes product inhibition.
