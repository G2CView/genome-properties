CC  Involved in electron transport during anaerobic respiration: electrons
CC  are passed from the formate dehydrogenase-N (Fdh-N) complex (CPX-1975)
CC  to nitrate reductase (NarGHI) complex via a quinone-quinol redox
CC  reaction. Within NarGHI, the distal heme molecule of NarI receives
CC  electrons from quinol (hydroquinone), passes them on to the proximal
CC  heme which passes it down a Fe-S cluster chain to the molybdopterin
CC  cofactor Mo-bisMGD where they reduce nitrate to nitrite. The
CC  collaboration of these two complexes contributes to the proton motive
CC  force: electrons are ultimately donated to Fdh-N by formate in the
CC  periplasm, transported to the cytoplasm and accepted by nitrate.
CC  Hydrogen ions are transported in the opposite direction: Quinone is
CC  reduced to quinol by cytoplasmic protons which are in turn released
CC  into the periplasm when quinol is oxidized to quinone.
