CC  This genome property refers to several related molybdopterin-containing 
CC  enzymes for a distinct class within the broader set of DMSO reductase 
CC  family enzymes. The most distinct feature is the heme b-containing gamma 
CC  subunit. However, both the molybdopterin-containing alpha subunit and the 
CC  iron-sulfur cluster-containing beta subunit are readily separable by 
CC  phylogenetic analysis from multiple sequence alignments. Many of these 
CC  complexes act in anaerobic respiration, including a selenate reductase, 
CC  a chlorate reductase, and a nitrate reductase.
**  I could require the chaperone by broadening the model and doing
**  HMM-CLUST.
