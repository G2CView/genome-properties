DE  TonB-dependent transport

TH  0
CC  The components of a TonB-dependent transport system include ExbB, ExbD,
CC  and TonB, respectively homologous to TolQ, TolR, and TolA of related
CC  tol-pal system. But while the tol-pal system includes seven genes
CC  altogether, including the peptidoglycan associated lipoprotein Pal, and
CC  seems required for maintaining integrity of the outer membrane, TonB
CC  systems tend to be required for siderophore or B12 uptake when mutant
CC  phenotypes are observed. At least two different exbB/exbD gene pair
CC  families exist, and two different pairs of HMMs currently model two
CC  different classes. The capacity for TonB-dependent transport is also
CC  marked by the presence of TonB-dependent transporters, which share a
CC  region of homology and may number more than 50 in a single genome.
