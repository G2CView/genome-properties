CC  At least five pathways exist for propionate catabolism in prokaryotes:
CC  the malonic semialdehyde-CoA pathway, acrylate pathway,
CC  methylmalonyl-CoA mutase pathway, alpha-hydroxyglutaric acid pathway,
CC  and methylcitric acid cycle pathway.
**  methylcitric acid has a variant in S. typhimurium: PduW/Pta parallel to
**  PrpE.
