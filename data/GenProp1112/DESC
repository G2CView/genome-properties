CC  Key enzyme linking the Krebs cycle with the respiratory chain in
CC  aerobic respiration. Catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate
CC  and the reduction of quinone to quinol. Electrons flow from the
CC  FAD-bound succinate through the Fe-S clusters to a b556 heme. Electrons
CC  ultimately reduce quinone to quinol in the membrane bound part of the
CC  enzyme. Under most conditions the electrons are used to reduce oxygen,
CC  allowing ATP synthesis. Member of the Complex II family. The
CC  functionally inverse complex found in anaerobic respiration is the QFR
CC  complex (CPX-1967).
