CC  This category unites properties describing microbial processes that
CC  coordinate behavior between cells. These include quorum-sensing,
CC  biofilm formation, and various other signal-mediated interactions.
**  But let us exclude mating type behaviors, mostly. Contact mediated and
**  signal-mediated both?
