CC  Phosphonatase (PhnX) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 
CC  phosphonoacetaldehyde via a bicatalytic mechanism involving a specific 
CC  enzyme lysine which forms a Shiff base with the aldehyde, and a 
CC  magnesium-aspartate (HAD-type) nucleophile to cleave the phosphonate 
CC  carbon-phosphorous bond. The PhnW enzyme provides the substrate for this 
CC  reaction. HpnX (closely related to PhnX) shares a significant degree of 
CC  similarity at critical catalytic sites suggesting that it also acts as a 
CC  phosphonatase on a beta-phosphonoaldehyde. HpnX genes are often found in the 
CC  vicinity of a family of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases (HpnW). These genes 
CC  may act in an analagous fashion to PhnW by converting an aminophosphonate 
CC  into an aldehyde, here by oxidative deamination. HpnW genes are members of 
CC  a larger family of genes including enzymes with amino acid deaminating 
CC  oxidase activities. These genes (HpnX and HpnW) are often associated with a 
CC  family of Zn++ dependent alcohol dehydrogenases. Other genes in the vicinity 
CC  indicate a phosphonate-related context and are typically observed near other 
CC  phosphonate catabolic pathways such as genes of the HDIG domain family, 
CC  certain GntR-type transcriptional regulators and phosphonate-related 
CC  transporters.
