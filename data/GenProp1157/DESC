CC  A member of the TonB-dependent transporter family (TBDTs) which binds
CC  and then transports cobalamine (vitamin B12) across the outer membrane.
CC  TBDTs are energy-dependent gated channels that usually transport large
CC  metal complexes which cannot fit through porins, and are too scarce to
CC  enter by mass-action-driven transport. Energy-dependent uptake through
CC  TBDTs requires interaction with TonB in complex with ExbB and ExbD in
CC  the inner membrane, ExbBD. TonB undergoes rapid energized movement
CC  driven by ExbBD which harvests the electrochemical force from the
CC  proton gradient across the inner membrane and converts it into rotational 
CC  motion. Hence, TonB may pull or twist the N-termini of TBDTs to promote 
CC  transport of substrates into the periplasm. ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) 
CC  transporters subsequently move the cyanocobalamine through the periplasm 
CC  and inner membrane.
