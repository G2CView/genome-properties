CC  Glucose (in the first two steps of the pentose phosphate pathway) or
CC  gluconate (in one step) can be converted to 6-phospho-D-gluconate. The
CC  Entner-Doudoroff pathway is the degradation of 6-phospho-D-gluconate in
CC  two steps to pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The
CC  D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate can then be converted to pyruvate by
CC  enzymes from glycolysis. This bacterial pathway is less widespread than
CC  glycolysis and is an alternative to the early steps of glycolysis. 
**  The aldolase part scares me, and it is clustered often enough that I
**  elect to require clustering for preliminary form of this property.
