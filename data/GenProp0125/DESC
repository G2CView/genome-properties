CC  The basic amino acid lysine is synthesized in most bacteria and plants
CC  via a nine step pathway from aspartate (via aspartate semialdehyde
CC  which is also used in a number of other pathways). Most species utilize
CC  succinate (from succinyl-CoA) to make an important amide linkage in the
CC  ring-opening of piperidine dicarboxylate. The succinate is then
CC  hydrolyzed several steps later. Other species carry out analogous
CC  transformations with acetate (from acetyl-CoA). Chlamydia and
CC  cyanobacteria have been shown to utilize a direct aminotransferase path
CC  without the acylation/deacylation steps, and a number of other species
CC  apparently also use this variant [1]. Each of these variants are included
CC  within this property. Certain obligate intracellular organisms such as 
CC  Coxiella, Rickettsia and Wolbachia, contain all but the final step 
CC  (diaminopimelate decarboxylase) of this pathway. Presumably these 
CC  organisms have no need of lysine biosynthesis, being able to obtain it 
CC  from their hosts. The products of the penultimate two steps however, 
CC  LL- and meso-diaminopimelate, are required components of the bacterial 
CC  cell wall, and so the rest of the pathway persists. There is a 
CC  possibility that the decarboxylase exists in these organsims but is 
CC  undetected. 
**  A closely related variant (GenProp0788) utilizes the NADPH-dependent 
**  enzyme diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (ddh) which incorporates ammonia 
**  directly and creates the meso-isomer of diaminopimelate, bypassing the 
**  need for the epimerase, DapE. A completely different pathway via 
**  alpha-amino adipate exists in fungi and certain bacteria (GenProp0193). 
**  Evidence for step 6 is also used for GP0788.
