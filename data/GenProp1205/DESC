CC  Reduces trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) to trimethylamine, enabling its
CC  use under anaerobic conditions as an electron acceptor for the
CC  oxidation of organic substrates and the production of energy. TorAC is
CC  also present under aerobic conditions, when production of alkaline
CC  trimethylamine may balance the acidification of the cell caused by
CC  generation of acetic acid caused by glycerol utilization.
