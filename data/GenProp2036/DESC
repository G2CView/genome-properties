CC  The vertebrate nuclear pore complex (NPC) has eight-fold radial
CC  symmetry. The core complex consists of globular subunits that
CC  are sandwiched between two coaxial ring-like structures. The 
CC  ring facing the nuclear interior is capped by a fibrous structure 
CC  called the nuclear basket [1]. NUP160, NUP133, NUP107 and NUP96
CC  form the Nup160 subcomplex [4,5], which plays a role in RNA export 
CC  and tethering NUP98 and NUP153 to the nucleus [2]. Nup98 must 
CC  process itself autoproteolytically [3]. Tpr forms the nuclear
CC  basket. The Tpr N terminus interacts with NUP153 in the NPC [6] 
CC  while the acidic C terminus is transported into the nuclear 
CC  interior, where is interacts with soluble transport factors and 
CC  can mediate export of macromolecules from the nucleus [7].
**  The same precursor yields Nup96 and Nup98.
**  NUP98 is an endopeptidase (MEROPS ID S59.001).
**  The NPC in yeast is more complex and is a separate Genome 
**  Property.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used in GP2037 and GP2042.
**  Evidence for step 3 is also used in GP2037, GP2042 and GP2043.
**  Threshold is therefore set to 2.
