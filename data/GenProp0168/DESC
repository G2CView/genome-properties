CC  Glycogen and starch are related glucose storage polysaccharides. Alpha
CC  1,4 glucan linkages predominate, with some branching using alpha 1,6
CC  linkages. The relative level of branching determines whether the
CC  substance is called glycogen or starch. In bacteria and plants, the
CC  precursor is ADP-glucose. In animals, the precursor is  UDP-glucose.
CC  Different forms of glycogen synthase are used for the two. This
CC  property includes the enzyme phosphorylase (glycogen phosphorylase or 
CC  starch phosphorylase, depending on context) necessary to release 
CC  glucose-1-phosphate from the polysaccharide.
**  It is not yet defined here whether glycogen-like storage polymer
**  systems, such as found in Streptococcus mutans, will be included within
**  this property or not.  Just added 4-alpha-glucanotransferase as an
**  in_rule=0 step, found it (amylo) fits quite well with glgP.  Rewrite
**  comment to reflect. DHH.
**  Evidence for step 5 is also used for GP0264.
