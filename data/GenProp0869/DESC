CC  This Genome Property represents a proton-motive cycle. A cycle of
CC  decarboxylating an arginine to agmatine plus CO2, then exchanging the
CC  cytosolic agmatine for an extracellular arginine, has the net effect of
CC  consuming one proton. The Chlamydophila pneumoniae system, unlike the
CC  E. coli system, has a third component, and outer membrane porin.
CC  Analogous systems for antiport of substrates related by decarboxylation
CC  include, for example, the pairing of an asparate decarboxylase with an
CC  aspartate-alanine antiporter, as in Tetragenococcus halophila. 
**  An apparent projection into Yersinina (adjacent genes homologous to
**  each) might be same substrate pair, might be more generic. Investigate,
**  or use as demo for class-level extrapolation. The enzyme 4.1.1.19 shows
**  up also in other contexts (see TIGR00286 and the biosynthetic form
**  TIGR01273).
