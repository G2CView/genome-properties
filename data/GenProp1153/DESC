CC  An SF2 ATPase that orchestrates a preferential pathway for nucleotide
CC  excision repair (NER) called transcription-coupled repair (TCR) by
CC  specific recognition of the transcription and NER assemblies. First,
CC  TRCF relieves transcription-dependent NER inhibition due to occlusion
CC  of the DNA lesion by RNAP. TRCF approaches the stalled RNAP from behind
CC  and induces its forward translocation and subsequent release by
CC  stepping on dsDNA using ATP hydrolysis. The consequent collapse of the
CC  upstream end of the transcription bubble leads to a massive
CC  destabilization of the otherwise stable ternary elongation complex,
CC  consisting of the open DNA transcription fork and the newly-synthesised
CC  RNA, and transcription termination. Second, TRCF recruits the UvrABC
CC  repair system (CPX-2151, CPX-2152, CPX-2153) to the unmasked lesion by
CC  binding to UvrA, a subunit of the UvrAB complex (CPX-2151). UvrA
CC  binding to TRCF and UvrB are probably mutually exclusive owing to the
CC  conserved interface on UvrA. Formation of the TRCF-UvrA complex
CC  initiates a cascade of events resulting in lesion excision and gap
CC  filling. TRCF also has roles beyond TCR - in the rescue of replication
CC  forks stalled by head-on collisions with RNAPs, in the development of
CC  antibiotic resistance, recombination, and transcriptional regulation.
