RT  Regulation of the Escherichia coli tna operon: nascent leader peptide
RT  control at the tnaC stop codon.

CC  This property is characterized by two components. One is the enzyme
CC  tryptophanase, capabable of degrading tryptophan. The other is the
CC  tryptophanase leader peptide, TnaC, encoded upstream of the enzyme. The
CC  ribosome that translates the leader peptide may stall at either of two
CC  points: the trp codon (when trp is scarce) or the stop codon. The
CC  leader peptide may interact with ribosome to delay release at its stop
CC  codon. Whether the ribosome stalls at the trp codon or continues to the
CC  stop codon controls what mRNA secondary structure may form as the
CC  trytophanase message is synthesized. When trp is scarce, and the enzyme
CC  should not be made, a terminator forms and transcription ends. Examples 
CC  of this mechanism for controlling transcription at termination are called
CC  transcriptional attenuation.
**  BEWARE: often the leader peptide gene is not called. The PFAM version
**  HMM hits only seed members.
