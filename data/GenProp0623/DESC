CC  This gene cluster (snoABCDEFG) has been proposed [1] to encode a
CC  alternative NADH dehydrogenase complex I based on homology to known
CC  complex I subunits and certain knockout phenotype characteristics in
CC  Staphylococcus aureus.  The cluster had been previously characterized
CC  as a sodium-proton antiporter.
