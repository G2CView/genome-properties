CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. Jansen, et al. describe CRISPR loci as
CC  having direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by
CC  similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. Variants of CRISP/Cas loci
CC  (subtypes) have been described [2] in which certain groups of 
CC  subtype-specific genes are found in addition to characteristic sets of 
CC  the more widely distributed cas genes. The Dvulg subtype, so named 
CC  because this subtype is the only one found in the genome of 
CC  Desulfovibrio vulgaris, also called type I-C, consists of cas1-5 and 
CC  the subtype specific genes csd1-2. The repeats associated with this 
CC  subtype tend to have a periodicity of 66 nucleotides. This subtype is 
CC  found in a wide variety of bacteria and never in the Archaea. Cas2 in 
CC  this system has been shown to act as an endonuclease for dsDNA rather 
CC  than ssRNA.
