CC  A DNA gyrase of type IIA topoisomerase that negatively supercoils
CC  closed circular double-stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent manner and also
CC  catalyzes the interconversion of other topological isomers of
CC  double-stranded DNA rings, including catenanes and knotted rings. It
CC  cleaves both strands and facilitates DNA melting at oriC in order for
CC  replication initiation to take place. Gyrase also removes the
CC  left-handed positive supercoiling generated in front of moving
CC  replication forks. It is vital in all bacteria but not found in
CC  eukaryotes except some plant organelles. Structure-guided deletion of a
CC  170-amino acid insertion (Thr565 - Arg731) in GyrB greatly reduces the
CC  DNA binding, supercoiling and DNA-stimulated ATPase activities of
CC  gyrase.
