CC  RecFOR is a system for homologous recombination, a nearly universal
CC  housekeeping process especially important for repair. RecFOR acts
CC  independently from the RecBCD system, or the AddAB system that replaces
CC  RecBCD in certain lineages, and the presence of RecFOR is actually
CC  positively correlated with the presence of RecBCD/AddAB, so these two
CC  presynaptic systems that act in loading RecA may be regarded as
CC  complementary. RecFOR especially repairs single-stranded gaps while
CC  RecBCD/AddAB repairs double-stranded DNA ends, although roles for
CC  RecFOR in double stranded break repair are shown in discussion of RecN
CC  and RecQ function and of recBCD mutants. RecFOR systems often are
CC  assisted in an early step by the exonuclease RecJ. Following strand
CC  exchange by RecA, Holliday junction resolution may be done by RuvABC or
CC  RecG. The action of the RecFOR pathway involves formation of RecOR
CC  complexes, and RecFR complexes, but no complex of all three. Of the
CC  three genes, either RecO or RecF may be missing while the other two
CC  components are present, but RecR must be present in genomes with any
CC  part of this system.
**  PMID:11807051 says RecN belongs to both systems: RecFOR and RecBCD.
**  However, the Rocha, et al. paper Fig 2 shows it clearly more correlated
**  to RecFOR (although they do NOT discuss recN). DHH.
