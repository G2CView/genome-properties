CC  Glyoxalate is a common intermediate produced by a number of catabolic
CC  and anapleurotic pathways, notably the breakdown for allantoate,
CC  proline and glycine and the glyoxalate shunt. This pathway is initiated
CC  by the incorporation of carbon dioxide utilizing the TPP-dependent
CC  enzyme, tartronate-semialdehyde synthase (aka glyoxalate carbo-ligase,
CC  gcl).  Note that this is not a carbon-fixation pathway.  For instance,
CC  in the case of allantoate catabolism, the production of glyoxalate also
CC  produces one or more molecules of carbon dioxide.  Intermediates in
CC  this pathway (tartronate semialdehyde, and glycerate) may be diverted
CC  to other final products involved, for instance in covactor
CC  biosynthesis. Phosphoglycerate may be put to a large number of
CC  metabolic uses.
