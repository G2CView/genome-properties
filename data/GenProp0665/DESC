RT  Diverse bacterial genomes encode an operon of two genes, one of which
RT  is an unusual class-I release factor that potentially recognizes
RT  atypical mRNA signals other than normal stop codons.

CC  This genome property describes a novel two-gene operon that consists of
CC  PrfH, which is a member of the bacterial class I peptide chain release
CC  factors, and a homolog of RctB, which is a protein of unknown function
CC  thought suggest to act in RNA processing.
