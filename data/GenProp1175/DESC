CC  Catalyses the initial steps of thiamine (vitamin B1) pyrophosphate
CC  synthesis by donating the sulfur for the synthesis of the intermediate
CC  thiazole phosphate moiety. This step is ATP-dependent as ThiS is
CC  temporarity adenylated by ThiF. A further persulfate group is donated
CC  to the intermediate products by ThiI (P77718).
