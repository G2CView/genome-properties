CC  Coenzyme B is 7-mercaptoheptanoylthreoninephosphate. Coenzyme M and
CC  coenzyme B for a heterodisulfide during a key step in methanogenesis.
CC  This property is inactive: equivalog-level HMMs to provide evidence for
CC  computing this pathway are not yet available.
**  alpha-ketosuberate is a precursor of this and biotin.
**  7-mercaptoheptanoic acid is a constituent of coenzyme B and an
**  intermediate in its biosynthesis. INTERPRO MODEL GENOME PROPERTY? See
