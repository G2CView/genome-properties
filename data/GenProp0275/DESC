CC  This property covers that part of the Vitamin B12 (cobalamin)
CC  biosynthesis pathway in which uroporphyrinogen III is converted to
CC  cobyrinic acid diamide under anaerobic conditions. This process
CC  differs from the aerobic version in several key respects. The most
CC  striking is the fact that here the cobalt atom is inserted early in the
CC  process (after the formation of the branchpoint compound precorrin-2 by
CC  CbiK or CbiX) in an ATP-independent manner, as opposed to the aerobic
CC  pathway in which the cobalt is inserted at the end by a multimeric
CC  ATP-hydrolyzing system. Another distinctive feature is the nature of
CC  the enzyme catalyzing the oxidative ring contraction. In the aerobic
CC  pathway, this is carried out by an oxygenase (CobG), while the
CC  as-of-yet uncharacterized anaerobic enzyme clearly must utilize some
CC  other mechanism. Finally, the methylation at position C-1 at the point
CC  of the ring contraction is carried out by CobF in the aerobic pathway,
CC  and by an as-of-yet uncharacterized enzyme in the anaerobic pathway
CC  (presumably because the proximity of this carbon to the cobalt changes
CC  the chemistry somewhat). Two genes (CbiD and CbiG) are found in most
CC  anaerobic B12 biosynthetic clusters and have been shown to be essential
CC  to the pathway. CbiD is homologous to methylases and is likely to
CC  catalyze the C-1 methylation. CbiG then, by process of elimination and
CC  (coupled with unique nature of the chemical transformation) its lack of
CC  homology to other known classes of enzyme, is likely to catalyze the
CC  ring contraction. CbiJ, the analog of precorrin-6x reductase (CobK),
CC  is not found in deltaproteobacteria, a number of archaea and some other 
CC  species, often this is the only component missing. Most likely, an 
CC  unknown reductase replaces CbiJ/CobK in these species. For this reason 
CC  the detection of this component is not a required step in this property.    
CC  The majority of genomes for which some evidence has been asserted, are 
CC  missing evidence of the CbiK or CbiX chelatase. This step is still 
CC  required for the assertion of the YES state since it is part of the 
CC  suite of components which are diagnostic for the anaerobic pathway. The
CC  evidence for the anaerobic pathway is nonetheless quite strong when
CC  this is the only component missing, especially when the aerobic pathway
CC  is not supported.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0113.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0113.
**  Evidence for step 8 is also used for GP0113.
