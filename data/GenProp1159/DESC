CC  Binding of enzyme IIA (EIIA-Glc), a component of the glucose-specific
CC  phosphotransferase system, inhibits maltose transport from the
CC  periplasm to the cytoplasm. Two molecules of EIIA-Glc each bind
CC  allosterically to both subunits of MalK thereby fastening the maltose
CC  transporter in the open, inward-facing conformation which prevents the
CC  binding of maltose-loaded maltose binding protein MBP (MalE)
CC  (CPX-1932). Only the non-phosphorylated form of enzyme IIA functions
CC  as a maltose uptake inhibitor.
