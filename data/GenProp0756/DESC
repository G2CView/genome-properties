CC  Fumarate reductase reversibly converts succinate to fumarate with the
CC  concomitant production of FADH2. It consists of four components, a
CC  flavoprotein, an iron-sulfur protein, and two other subunits. It is a
CC  component of the reverse TCA carbon fixation pathway as well as certain
CC  fermentation pathways. Although reversible, certain enzymes have
CC  evolved to prefer one direction over the other, this property captures
CC  those which are likely to function in the process of fumarate
CC  reduction.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0033.
