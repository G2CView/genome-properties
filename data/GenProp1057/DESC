CC  This Genome Property represents a functional cassette (with unknown
CC  boundaries) in several species of Geobacter, in genomic regions that
CC  include high-molecular-weight cytochrome c family proteins. The
CC  cassette has a PqqD family protein, a radical SAM/SPASM domain protein
CC  similar to PqqE, and an additional SPASM domain protein that appears
CC  also to have a degenerate radical SAM-like region. Unlike the
CC  SynChlorMet system, with similar components, no putative precursor
CC  peptide for ribosomal natural product formation has been found.
**  Producing a heme variant, like NirJ proteins, is a possibility. Why did
**  I call it GeoRSP?  It is in Geobacter, with a Radical Sam enzyme and a
**  SPASM domain (PseudoSAM) protein
