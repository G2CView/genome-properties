CC  This Genome Property describes a two-gene system, usually occurring as
CC  a fusion protein. One member is an uncharacterized radical SAM protein.
CC  The other member is uncharacterized protein TIGR03936.
**  probably housekeeping. Exploring just with sporulating Actinobacteria
**  (tiny fraction of range), 49 of first 53 homologs to TIGR03936 were
**  among the 64 sporulators, meaning inheritance (if not universal
**  conservation) from parent node down, not lateral transfer.
