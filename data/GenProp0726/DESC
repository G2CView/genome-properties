CC  The enzyme selenide, water dikinase (SelD) activates selenium for use in
CC  bacteria as selenocysteine to be incorporated during protein
CC  translation, or as the modified base selenouridine in certain tRNAs.
CC  However, SelD occurs in some genomes with neither of those traits, and
CC  instead acts in the post-translational addition of a labile selenium to
CC  a molybdenum-containing cofactor. A bioinformatic analysis showed that
CC  the family of TIGRFAMs model TIGR03309 represents a third
CC  selenium-dependent bacterial trait, and that it is quite widespread.
CC  The current version of this Genome Property includes both selenium
CC  cofactor maturation proteins and subunits of predicted labile selenium
CC  cofactor enzymes.
**  Should be re-evaluated using new HMP reference genomes, and should be
**  split into two properties.
**  Evidence for step 5 is also used for GP0016 and GP0692.
