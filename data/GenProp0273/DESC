CC  This pathway represents the bacterial version of degradation of
CC  protocatechuate to beta-ketoadipate. It is often referred to as the
CC  protocatechuate branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway, in contrast to
CC  the catechol branch. Protocatechuate can be reached in one step from
CC  3-hydroxybenzoate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, vanillate, etc, and in two steps
CC  from benzoate, and from other aromatic compounds. Note that catechol is
CC  another common intermediate in the degradation of aromatic compounds.
CC  The two branches converge at beta-ketoadipate. From there,
CC  beta-ketoadipate is degraded in a two-step pathway to succinyl-CoA and
CC  acetyl-CoA.
