CC  This uncharacterized operon may be an addiction module, although the
CC  two proteins, especially the second, are larger than typical for
CC  addiction modules. In five species in which it occurs so far, two loci
CC  are on plasmids and one in a CRISPR region. The upstream gene
CC  (TIGR02612) is a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding protein in the family of
CC  PF01381. The downstream gene (TIGR02613) belongs to the Fic family,
CC  where Fic itself regulates cell division. We have named the upstream
CC  and downstream proteins mobile mystery protein A and B, respectively.
