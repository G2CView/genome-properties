CC  Apoptosis or programmed cell death is the mechanism by which cells 
CC  in eukaryotes are killed.  Cysteine endopeptidases known as caspases 
CC  are activated and these deactivate cellular proteins, often by 
CC  cleaving within interdomain regions, thereby separating binding 
CC  domains of signal reception and transduction domains.  Caspases have
CC  a specificity for aspartyl bonds, which occur frequently in surface
CC  loops and interdomain regions of proteins.  Caspases involved in
CC  apoptosis are of two kinds: initiators and executors.  Initiator
CC  caspases activate the executor caspases which cleave other proteins
CC  in the cell.  There are at least four routes by which the initiator
CC  caspase precursors are activated.  This Genome Property describes
CC  caspase activation via calpain following calcium release during 
CC  the endoplasmic reticulum stress response [1].
**  Requires apoptosis review. 
**  Human caspase-12 is defective because of a frame-changing mutation.
**  Bonobo caspase-12 has the active site His replaced.
**  NDR is unaware of any publication that reports activation of an 
**  executor caspase by caspase-12. Ref [2] reports than caspase-12
**  induced cell death does not involve cleavage of caspase-3, DFF45 or 
**  Bid.
**  Calpain-1 or 2 is a heterodimer and probably should have its own 
**  Genome Property.
