CC  This model describes an ATP-dependent four-subunit enzyme, benzoyl-CoA
CC  reductase, that dearomatizes benzoyl-CoA to
CC  cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA. This enzyme acts under anaerobic
CC  conditions.
**  The bcr type (models TIGR02259,60,61,63) is one of (at least) two
**  types. See also the bddNOPQ type: see Azoarcus, ntae01.
