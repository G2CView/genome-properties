CC  Bacteriorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump with a covelently bound
CC  cofactor, retinal, derived from beta-carotene. Phototrophic bacteria
CC  may have several bacterio-opsin homologs. The protein Blh has been
CC  shown to be a monooxygenase, that creates two retinal molecules from 
CC  oxygen and one beta-carotene. This property describes light 
CC  energy-capturing systems with these components.
