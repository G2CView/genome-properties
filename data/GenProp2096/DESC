CC  Insulin is secreted by the pancreatic beta cells. Its
CC  secretion can be stimulated by the import of glucose
CC  via a surface transporter, and metabolism of glucose
CC  increases intracellular ATP, inhibiting ATP-sensitive
CC  potassium channels, causing an influx of calcium into
CC  the cell [1].  Alternatively, there are surface 
CC  receptors for acetylcholine, CCK and FA.  Binding 
CC  leads to activation of PLC, which generates the second 
CC  messenger diacylglycerol, and PKC [2], followed by 
CC  release of insulin from insulin secretory granules.
