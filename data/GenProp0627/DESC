RT  Knock-out of SO1377 gene, which encodes the member of a conserved
RT  hypothetical bacterial protein family COG2268, results in alteration of
RT  iron metabolism, increased spontaneous mutation and hydrogen peroxide
RT  sensitivity in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.

CC  The knockout of SO1377 in Shewanella oneidensis results in oxidative
CC  damage related to changes in iron metabolism [1].  The adjacent gene,
CC  SO1366 is phylogenomically linked and part of an apparent operon.
