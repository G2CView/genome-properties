CC  L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid (Dap) is an intermediate in the
CC  biosynthesis of a number of metabolites, such as the siderophore
CC  staphyloferrin B. Cheung, et al. [1] cite their own unpublished
CC  results that SbnA and SbnB produce Dap. SbnA is a pyridoxal
CC  phosphate-dependent enzyme distantly related to diaminopropionate
CC  ammonia-lyase. SbnB shows homology to an NAD-dependent alanine
CC  dehydrogenase of Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The two occasionally occur as
CC  a fusion protein.
**  The two models do not find all homologs. For instance,the VioB and VioK
**  GB|AAP92492.1 and GB|AAP92501.1 of Streptomyces vinaceus are both below
**  cutoff, although their top hits in Omniome all are above.
