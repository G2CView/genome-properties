CC  The amino acid proline is synthesized in three steps from glutamate via
CC  L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde which non-enzymatically cyclizes to
CC  delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Glutamate semialdehyde can also arise
CC  from transamination of ornithine. Proline may also be synthesized
CC  directly from ornithine by the action of ornithine cyclodeaminase. 
CC  These alternate paths are not covered by this property.
