CC  Formed from components of the phn operon in gram-negative bacteria that
CC  facilitates the internalization and degradation of organophosphonates.
CC  Carbon-phosphorous lyase (CP lyase) and alpha-D-ribose
CC  1-methylphosphonate 5-triphosphate synthase activites have been
CC  attributed to at least the PhnG, PhnH, PhnI, PhnJ, PhnK and PhnL
CC  components of the Phn operon. It is unclear which of the subunits are
CC  absolutely necessary for each activity. PhnG, PhnH, PhnI and PhnL have
CC  alpha-D-ribose 1-methylphosphonate 5-triphosphate synthase activity and
CC  PhnJ has alpha-D-ribose 1-methylphosphonate 5-phosphate C-P-lyase
CC  activity in vitro. However, PhnJ can only be isolated in a complex of
CC  at least PhnG, PhnH, PhnI, PhnJ and PhnK but this complex is
CC  catalytically inactive, possibly because it lacks PhnL.
