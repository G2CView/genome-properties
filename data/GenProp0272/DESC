CC  Energy metabolism from sugars leads to flux through pyruvate. Pyruvate
CC  metabolism under limited oxygen may lead to fermentation with acidic
CC  end products. Pyruvate may be converted to acetoin in two steps, and in
CC  some species from acetoin to 2,3-butanediol, a neutral compound, so
CC  homeostasis can be maintained. This property describes the catabolic
CC  form of acetolactate synthase (distinguished from forms used in
CC  branched chain amino acid biosynthesis - see TIGR00118) and
CC  alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase.
**  A regulator alsR in Bacillus subtilis, LysR family, divergent from
**  operon of this property, seems a poor candidate for an HMM. I explored
**  making TIGRO2415, meso-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, an extra (in_rule
**  0) to this property and did NOT like it: same operons, it seems, only
**  in Klebsiella terrigena and Enterobacter aerogenes, which are not in
**  OMNIOME, and poorly correlated even for being in same genome.
