CC  In many species with methionine salvage from methylthioadenosine, a
CC  single protein (MtnC) acts as an enolase-phosphatase. However, in
CC  Bacillus subtilis and related species, the enolase and phosphate are
CC  separate proteins designated MtnW and MtnX. The former resembles
CC  RuBisCO and the latter belongs to the HAD superfamily hydrolases.
