CC  Properties in this category describe the general class of biological system
CC  in which an essentially irreversible enzymatic process (such as
CC  decarboxylation) converts one substrate of an antiporter into the
CC  other, so that extrusion of the enzymatic product leads to import of
CC  new substrate. An example of such a system is the pairing of asparate
CC  decarboxylase (which produces alanine plus CO2) with an aspartate
CC  alanine antiporter. The net result of each cycle is removal of one
CC  cytosolic proton, therefore such systems can and do confer acid resistance.
**  Sample antiporter pairs related by decarboxylation include
**  aspartate:alanine, arginine:agmatine, histidine:histamine,
**  lysine:cadaverine, and ornithine:putrescine.
