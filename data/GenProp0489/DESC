CC  F-type plasmid conjugation systems are those distinctive of the
CC  F-plasmid first described in E.coli. This system consists of a type-IV
CC  pilus specialized for plasmid DNA transduction as well as specialized
CC  machinery for mating-type recognition in the recipient cell and a
CC  relaxosome and coupling protein system for initiating and providing
CC  energy for the transfer. Two genome properties, GenProp0484 and
CC  GenProp0485, encapsulate the F-type-specific and generic components 
CC  repectively. The generic components are found in non-F-type
CC  conjugative systems such as the P and I-like systems. 
**  This parent
**  property will match the state of the specific components property
**  (GenProp0484) except in the following cases: when the specific property
**  is YES and the generic property is less than YES, this property will
**  assign the state, some evidence; when the specific property is assigned
**  the state, none found, and the generic property is assigned a state
**  greater than none found, this property will assign the state, not
**  supported.
