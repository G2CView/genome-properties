CC  Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module consisting of relA toxin and relB
CC  antitoxin. TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence and
CC  are composed of a toxin, which causes growth arrest by interfering with
CC  a vital cellular process, and a cognate antitoxin, which neutralizes
CC  the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. Under conditions
CC  of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded, leaving the toxins
CC  to exert their toxic effects, leading to growth arrest and dormancy.
CC  Type II TA complexes are small protein-protein pairs; under growth
CC  conditions, the toxin is bound to the antitoxin, which inhibits its
CC  activity. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind
CC  the TA promoter to repress transcription. Under stress conditions,
CC  cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176) are
CC  activated that preferentially cleave the antitoxins, freeing the toxins
CC  to inhibit growth by inhibiting translation or replication, enabling
CC  cells to enter a metabolically dormant state until the stress is
CC  removed. Free RelE toxin is capable of cleaving mRNA during translation
CC  at the ribosomal A site, thus inhibiting translation during amino acid
CC  starvation (the stringent response). The antitoxin, RelB, both binds
CC  and inhibits RelE by inducing conformational changes in the RelE active
CC  site, and regulates transcription through operator binding and
CC  conditional cooperativity controlled by RelE. During nutritional
CC  stress, the labile RelB is degraded by Lon, releasing RelE.
