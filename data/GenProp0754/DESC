CC  Acetate may be generated from acetyl phosphate by hydrolysis (EC 3.6.1.7,
CC  acylphosphatase) or by a reversible ATP-dependent reaction (EC 2.7.2.1,
CC  ATP:acetate phosphohydrolase). The literature also refers to a reversible 
CC  pyrophophate-dependent reaction in Entamoeba histolytica [1] although the 
CC  sequence of the enzyme responsible is not yet known.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0478.
