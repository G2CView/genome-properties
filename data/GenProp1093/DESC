CC  An abortive infection system is any system that interferes with the
CC  ability of a phage to replicate successfully after it has infected a
CC  prokaryotic cell. Mechanisms vary widely, and may include blockage of a
CC  specific step in phage replication, or else shutdown and/or death of
CC  the host cell. This Genome Property is designed as a guild for proteins
CC  that have been described in publications as abortive infection proteins
CC  and that do not belong to CRISPR or restriction enzyme systems.
**  Many toxin-antitoxin system proteins MAY belong to this guild.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP1092 (GUILD).
