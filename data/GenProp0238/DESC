CC  The enzyme 2-aminoethylphosphonate--pyruvate transaminase (AEPT) 
CC  interconverts 2-aminoethylphosphonate plus pyruvate with
CC  2-phosphonoacetaldehyde plus alanine. The enzyme phosphonoacetaldehyde
CC  hydrolase, a HAD superfamily hydrolase, breaks the C-P bond, yielding
CC  acetaldehyde plus inorganic phosphate[1]. In species that appear to 
CC  encode a phosphonate ABC transporter, this property is likely to be 
CC  present only when the large phosphonate operon proposed to encode a
CC  multisubunit C-P lyase, as found in Escherichia coli, is not found.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0713 and GP0724.
