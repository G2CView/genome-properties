CC  Mycothiol is a thiol, a glutathione analog, found in Mycobacterium
CC  tuberculosis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Streptomyces coelicolor, and
CC  related species. Four genes associated with its biosynthesis,
CC  designated mshA, mshB, mshC, and mshD, are scattered in the M.
CC  tuberculosis genome rather than arranged as an operon. A fifth reaction
CC  associated with this biosynthesis, a phosphatase designated MsaA2, has
CC  been described by, apparently, not yet assigned to a specific protein.
CC  Genomes with this biosynthesis system will have other proteins that
CC  make use of mycothiol.
