CC  The E. coli O9 monomer is a linear pentasaccharide consisting solely of
CC  mannose units
CC  [->3)aDMan(1->3)aDMan(1->2)aDMan(1->2)aDMan(1->2)aDMan(1->] [1]. This
CC  structure is identical to the Citrobacter braakii O7a,3b,1c, Klebsiella
CC  pneumoniae O3, and Hafnia alvei PCM 1223 antigens [2]. It is believed
CC  that the MtfC mannosyltransferase is solely involved with the
CC  initiating transfer onto the LPS core, while MtfB and MtfA handle all
CC  the subsequent mannose 1->3 and 1->2 transfers respectively [3]. The O9
CC  antigen is very similar to the E. coli O8 antigen (GenProp1018),
CC  differing only in the number of consecutive 1->3 and 1->2 linkages.
CC  While the MtfC and MtfB are extremely similar to the corresponding O8
CC  enzymes WbdC and WbdB, MtfA and WbdA are quite distinct, exhibiting
CC  only 35% amino acid identity and 2 and 3 glycosyltransferase domains,
CC  respectively. Thus, these enzymes are likely responsible for the length
CC  and patterning of the monomer. Indeed, it has been shown that the O9a
CC  variant (which is one mannose shorter than O9) found in some E. coli
CC  strains is entirely due to a mutation in the MtfA gene [4]. These
CC  monomer units are handled in an ABC-transporter dependent process in
CC  which polymerization occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma
CC  membrane followed by transport (flipping) of the undecaprenyl-linked
CC  full-length polymer. It has been shown that the overall antigen chain
CC  length is determined by the addition of a methylphosphate moiety on the
CC  O3 position of the terminal mannose residue [5], and that this
CC  modification is carried out by the MtfD (WbdD(O9)) enzyme, which
CC  carries out the sequential kinase and methyltransferase functions [6].
CC  This is in contrast to the mechanism in the O8 antigen where only a
CC  methylase reaction is involved, and where the corresponding WbdD(O8)
CC  enzyme lacks a kinase domain. The ABC transporter appears to require
CC  the presence of the  modified final residue to move the polymer to the
CC  periplasmic side of the membrane in both systems.
