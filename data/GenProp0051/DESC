CC  Urease is a multi-subunit, nickel-containing enzyme required for the
CC  hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia [1]. Its three
CC  structural genes are located in an unidirectionally transcribed gene
CC  cluster consisting either as separate alpha, beta, and gamma subunits,
CC  or as in Helicobacter pylori, a fusion of beta and gamma subunits [2].
CC  Associated with these structural subunits are accessory factors
CC  functioning to assemble and incorporate its nickel-containing
CC  metallocenter [3]. This property predicts a urease system to be present
CC  if both its three structural subunits and four accessory proteins are
CC  all found. In Bacillus subtilis, the accessory proteins are not found
CC  by homology but urease function has been shown experimentally. This
CC  finding raises the question of what alternative mechanism can enable
CC  the assembly of functional urease.
