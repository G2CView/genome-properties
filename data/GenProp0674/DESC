CC  Malonate decarboxylase as found in Klebsiella pneumoniae is a
CC  multi-subunit water-soluble enzyme. In some species, such as
CC  Malonomonas rubra, soluble components are linked to membrane-bound
CC  enzymes and the system on the whole acts as a sodium pump. This
CC  property contains as required elements the subunits of the
CC  water-soluble enzyme and accessory proteins for biosynthesis and
CC  attachment of the 2'-(5''-phosphoribosyl)-3'-dephospho-CoA prosthetic
CC  group. The sodium pumping form can be recognized by the presence of a
CC  carboxybiotin decarboxylase subunit (TIGR03136) in the operon. 
**  Biotin-independent enzyme is 4.1.1.88. Biotin-dependent form is
**  4.1.1.89. Several components belong to both (TIGR03133, TIGR03130,
**  TIGR01110, variant of TIGR03132). Biotin use may be tied to Na+ pump
**  use as transporter. Individual subunits often have their own EC
**  numbers.
