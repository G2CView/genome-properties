CC  This system features a putative carrier protein, TIGR04557, related to
CC  the SoxY and SoxZ carrier complex of the sulfate oxidation cycle, as
CC  well as PQQ-dependent enzymes that have a Cys-Cys motif, and
CC  specialized cytochromes involved in electron transport. Authentic SoxY
CC  is a carrier protein for sulfur oxidation, with a covalent attachment 
CC  site near its C terminus, and a Cys residue in the context GGCGG or GGCG. 
CC  The  carrier Cys of SoxY is conserved in TIGR04557, but what might be 
CC  attached in the latter is unknown. GenProp0895 (alcohol ABC transporter, 
CC  PedABC-type) describes a four-gene operon closely tied to this system.
**  Some of this, mostly the fusion, may be new discovery. Property should
**  require PQQ biosynthesis (but that would make TIGR03075 count twice!).
**  TIGR03871 needs annotation help. Some of the additional correlated
**  proteins are subfamilies with multiple equivalogs, none universal and
**  often several paralogs per genome. Beware.
