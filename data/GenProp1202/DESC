CC  A protein complex integral to the bacterial electron transport chain.
CC  Electrons are donated by the oxidation of ubiquinol to ubiquinone and
CC  used to reduce molecular oxygen, generating a proton motive force using
CC  protons and electrons from opposite sides of the membrane to generate
CC  water. This complex appears to be expressed under micro-aerobic
CC  conditions or under conditions of phosphate starvation.
