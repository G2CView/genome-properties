CC  The O8 monomer is a linear trisaccharide consisting of three D-mannose
CC  units [-->3)-b-D-Man-(1-->2)-a-D-Man-(1-->2)-a-D-Man-(1-->]. This units
CC  are handled in an ABC-transporter dependent process in which
CC  polymerization occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane
CC  followed by transport (flipping) of the undecaprenyl-linked full-length
CC  polymer. The O8 antigen is reported to consist of 9 monomer units
CC  terminated by a single D-Man3Me residue. There are three
CC  mannosyltransferase enzymes involved in this process (MtfABC; in the
CC  identical Klebsiella O5, WbdABC). MtfB and MtfC are typical
CC  single-domain GT enzymes, while MtfA is much larger consisting of 3
CC  distinct domains, each from the GT1 superfamily (cdd03809, cdd03822 and
CC  cdd03801). MtfC and MtfB are believed to be involved in the synthesis
CC  of the post-priming adaptor, a disaccharide of mannose that precedes
CC  the regular monomer repeat pattern. MtfA and B are responsible for the
CC  monomer synthesis, with the long MtfA having a likely patterning role.
CC  The methyltransferase MtfD is the terminator and chain-length
CC  determinant, acting when the chain is the appropriate length by
CC  blocking the O3 position of the growing polymer. The ABC transporter
CC  appears to require the presence of the methylated final residue to move
CC  the polymer to the periplasmic side of the membrane.
