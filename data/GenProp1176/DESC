CC  Functions in both protein secretion to the trans side of the plasma
CC  membrane and insertion of membrane proteins into the lipid bilayer.
CC  Associates with the motor ATPase SecA, which drives post-translational
CC  translocation of pre-proteins across the membrane.Membrane proteins are
CC  targeted to the membrane co-translationally by the signal recognition
CC  particle (SRP) associating with its receptor at the cytosolic surface.
CC  The ribosome nascent chain complex is then passed onto the dimeric
CC  SecYEG complex and the nascent membrane protein is threaded through the
CC  protein channel and into the bilayer via a lateral gate. Also forms a
CC  holo-translocon super-complex comprising of the SecYEG core complex,
CC  the accessory sub-complex SecDF-YajC and YidC.
