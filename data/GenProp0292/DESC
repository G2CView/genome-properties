CC  Ethanolamine can be broken down to acetaldehyde by the action of
CC  ethanolamine ammonia lyase, an adenosyl cobalamin (vitamin B12)
CC  dependent enzyme. In its simplest form this system consists only of the
CC  two subunits of the enzyme, but ususally also includes a transporter
CC  for ethanolamine and may include a coexpressed acetaldehyde
CC  dehydrogenase to ensure that the toxic aldehyde is efficiently
CC  converted to acetyl-CoA. This property encompasses the more complex
CC  version of this system which includes additional genes coding for the
CC  proteinaceous coat of a specialized organelle as well as other genes
CC  for the efficienct maintenance and regulation of the lyase, handling of
CC  the product and import of the substrate. Presumably, this organellar
CC  system in organisms which may rely on ethanolamine as a primary carbon
CC  source.
**  How widespread is the polyhedral corboxysome shell protein association
**  into a ethanolamine degradation organelle?  a gene for the processing
**  of acetaldehyde to something less toxic should be present as well as
**  genes for the rescue of dead B12-enzyme
**  Evidence for step 7 is also used for GP0457, GP0458, GP0724 and GP0917.
**  Evidence for step 8 is also used for GP0294.
