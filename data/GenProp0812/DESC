CC  Transcriptional termination in bacteria occurs in two modes, one of
CC  them dependent on the termination factor Rho. Rho occurs in the
CC  overwhelming majority of bacteria, and is an essential protein in most
CC  but not all of those species. When Rho is present, the Nus factors
CC  (NusA, NusB, and NusG) participate in Rho-dependent termination,
CC  although those proteins have other functions as well and are more
CC  nearly universal than Rho itself.
