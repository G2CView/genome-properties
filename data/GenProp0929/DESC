CC  The LPS outer core of E. coli and related species contains a set of
CC  glucosamine and galactose sugar residues positioned between the inner
CC  core heptose residues and the O-antigen.  The O-antigen is attached to
CC  the outer core via the terminal glucosamine residue.  The precise
CC  structure of the outer core varies by serovar (strain).  The genes for
CC  the outer core are often observed interspersed with the more highly
CC  conserved and more easily identifiable genes for the inner core.
