CC  A conserved four-gene operon, found regularly in genomes with PQQ
CC  biosynthesis and with PQQ-dependent enzymes for catabolism of various
CC  alcohols, appears to represent an alcohol import ABC transporter. This
CC  conclusion is based partly on recognizing one member of the operon as a
CC  likely periplasmic substrate-binding protein. An earlier view [1] 
CC  suggests this system to be an efflux transporter for removal of toxic 
CC  intermediates during catabolism.
