CC  This property describes de novo synthesis of the thiazole moiety of
CC  thiamine, hydroxyethylthiazole (HET). This requires more distinct
CC  proteins than that of the pyrimidine moeity, hydromethylpyrimidine
CC  (HMP). Phosphorylated forms of HET and HMP are connected by ThiE as
CC  thiamine phosphate and converted eventually to the active form thiamine
CC  pyrophosphate, TPP. HET biosynthesis requires the small ThiS protein,
CC  the C terminus of which becomes modified transiently by a sulfur atom
CC  from cysteine [1]. ThiG is required, along with either ThiH in species
CC  where tyrosine is a precursor or ThiO in species where glycine is a
CC  precursor. ThiF, although required biosynthetically, is not readily
CC  separated from MoeB, a molybdopterin biosynthesis protein, and so is
CC  not considered a required component. The ThiI gene is required, but 
CC  also serves in formation of a tRNA modified site in species that do 
CC  not make HET [2]. This property represents and alternative to HET 
CC  uptake as a means to obtain the thiazole component for thiamine 
CC  biosynthesis.
**  Either IscS or NifS must be present, but this requirement also is not 
**  included in the rule.
