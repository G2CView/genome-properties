CC  The switch the forces mammalian neural stem cells to
CC  differentiate is the change in the composition of the 
CC  neural, ATP-dependent SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling 
CC  complexes.  As progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate 
CC  into neurons exit components in the npBAF complex are
CC  replaced to form the nBAF complex [1].
CC  The nBAF complex is composed of at least ARID1A/BAF250A or 
CC  ARID1B/BAF250B, SMARCD1/BAF60A, SMARCD3/BAF60C, 
CC  SMARCA2/BRM/BAF190B, SMARCA4/BRG1/BAF190A, SMARCB1/BAF47, 
CC  SMARCC1/BAF155, SMARCE1/BAF57, SMARCC2/BAF170, DPF1/BAF45B, 
CC  DPF3/BAF45C, ACTL6B/BAF53B and actin.
**  Evidence for steps 10 and 11 is the same (IPR004000).
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used in GP2081 (IPR030094).
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used in GP2081 (IPR038040).
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used in GP2081 (IPR038041).
**  Evidence for step 3 is also used in GP2083 (IPR038043).
**  Evidence for step 4 is also used in GP02080, GP2081, GP2083 and GP2084 (IPR030088).
**  Evidence for step 5 is also used in GP2081, GP2083 and GP2084 (IPR030100).
