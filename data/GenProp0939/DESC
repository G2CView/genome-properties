CC  This Genome Property describes a broadly but sparsely distributed gene
CC  cluster that appears to be biosynthetic. The cluster includes a radical
CC  SAM protein, an N-acetyltransferase, a probable nitrilase, a
CC  flavin-dependent oxidoreductase, and several uncharacterized
CC  proteins.This assortment of functions suggests a biosynthetic rather
CC  than catabolic role for the cluster.
