CC  Formaldehyde, a toxic metabolite because it reacts easily with protein
CC  or DNA, naturally combines with reduced glutathione (GSH) to form
CC  S-hydroxymethyl-glutathione. In some species, this reaction is
CC  accelerated by the enzyme  S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione synthase, also
CC  called glutathione-dependent formaldehyde activating enzyme. A class
CC  III alcohol dehydrogenase, with activity for a variety of medium chain
CC  alcohols (but poor activity for ethanol) can convert
CC  S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione to S-formylglutathione, and therefore has
CC  been called glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase but is
CC  more properly called S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase for
CC  this activity. Finally, S-formylglutathione is converted to glutathione
CC  and formate by S-formylglutathione hydrolase, which has a dual role as
CC  a broadly specific esterase, called esterase D in animals. While the
CC  two essential enzymes of this pathway both have broad specificities,
CC  the pairing in operons in so many genomes demonstrates the recurring
CC  importance of formaldehyde detoxification.
