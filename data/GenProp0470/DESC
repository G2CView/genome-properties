CC  A conserved gene four-gene neighborhood is found sporadically in a
CC  phylogenetically broad range of bacteria: Nocardia farcinica,
CC  Symbiobacterium thermophilum, and Streptomyces avermitilis
CC  (Actinobacteria), Geobacillus kaustophilus (Firmicutes), and Azoarcus
CC  sp. EbN1 and Ralstonia solanacearum (Betaproteobacteria). It is found
CC  near CRISPR repeats in Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA426, whose genome
CC  has no identified Cas proteins. It is found near a cas gene cluster and
CC  its CRISPR repeats in another species.
