CC  Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module consisting of MazF toxin and MazE
CC  antitoxin. TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and persistence and
CC  are composed of a toxin, which causes growth arrest by interfering with
CC  a vital cellular process, and a cognate antitoxin, which neutralizes
CC  the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. Under conditions
CC  of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded, allowing the toxins
CC  to exert their toxic effects, leading to growth arrest and dormancy.
CC  Type II TA complexes are small protein-protein pairs; under growth
CC  conditions, the toxin is bound to the antitoxin, which inhibits its
CC  activity. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the TA complex bind
CC  the TA promoter to repress transcription. Under stress conditions,
CC  cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP (CPX-3176) are
CC  activated that preferentially cleave the antitoxins, freeing the toxins
CC  to inhibit growth by inhibiting translation or replication, enabling
CC  cells to enter a metabolically dormant state until the stress is
CC  removed. The complex binds to mazEF operon to inhibit its own
CC  transcription. Presence of free MazF toxin induces programmed cell
CC  death by cleavage of RNA specifically at ACA sequences to block protein
CC  synthesis. Binding of MazE antitoxin inhibits MazF endoribonuclease
CC  activity. Plays a role in biofilm formation.
