CC  This Genome Property describes a three-gene system of antimicrobial
CC  peptide and two export proteins modeled on SdpC (sporulation delay
CC  protein C) from Bacillus subtilis, a killing peptide that allows
CC  cannibalism to obtain nutrients and avoid the irreversible sporulation
CC  cascade. Related systems are sparsely but widely distributed.
CC  Additional components of the SdpABC system itself, such as immunity
CC  protein SdpI and regulatory proteins, were not recognized as universal
CC  to such systems by phylogenetic profiling mechanisms and are not
CC  modeled within this Genome Property.
