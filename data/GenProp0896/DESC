CC  This small clade of ABC-type transporters are found in Actinobacteria
CC  containing numerous genes requiring the coenzyme F420.  This property
CC  was defined based on five such organisms, four of which are lacking all
CC  F420 biosynthetic capability save the final side-chain polyglutamate
CC  attachment step (via the gene cofE: TIGR01916).  In Jonesia
CC  denitrificans DSM 20603 and marine actinobacterium PHSC20C1 this
CC  cassette is in an apparent operon with the cofE gene and, in PHSC20C1,
CC  also with a F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
CC  (TIGR03554).  Based on these observations we propose that this is an
CC  f420-0 (that is, F420 lacking only the polyglutamate tail) ABC
CC  transporter.
