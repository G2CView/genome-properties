RT  Identification and characterization of the first ovothiol biosynthetic
RT  enzyme.
RA  Braunshausen A, Seebeck FP;

CC  The first step in ovothiol A biosynthesis is conversion of cysteine and
CC  histidine to 5-histidylcysteine sulfoxide conjugate by
CC  5-histidylcysteine sulfoxide synthase. The conjugate is trimmed by a
CC  currently unknown mechanism (perhaps different enzymes in different
CC  species) to 5-thiohistidine, and is N-methylated at the pi position of
CC  the imidazole ring. Many OvaA (5-histidylcysteine sulfoxide synthase)
CC  have an additional C-terminal methyltransferase domain likely to
CC  provide this methyltransferase activity. Ovothiols B and C differ from
CC  ovothiol A by having additional methylations of the histidine-derived
CC  amino group.
**  PMID:3651433 says ovothiol A is 1-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine. Ovothiol
**  B is 1-methyl-N alpha-methyl-4-mercaptohistidine. 1-methyl-N alpha,N
**  alpha-dimethyl-4-mercaptohistidine is ovothiol C.
