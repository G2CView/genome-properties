CC  The arginine biosynthesis pathway is a three step process and a part of
CC  the urea cycle. The first enzyme, ornithine carbamoyltransferase
CC  (OTCase) carries out the reaction anabolically in arginine
CC  biosynthesis, but in some cases, it carries out catabolic reactions.
CC  Most OTCases are homotrimers, but the homotrimers are organized into
CC  dodecamers built from four trimers in at least two species; the
CC  catabolic OTCase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is allosterically regulated,
CC  while OTCase of the extreme thermophile Pyrococcus furiosus shows both
CC  allostery and thermophily [1]. The third step of the pathway yields
CC  L-arginine by argininosuccinate lyase, and the amino acid can be
CC  cleaved by arginase, yielding urea and reconstituting ornithine.
**  L-arginine also can be utilized in the creatine biosynthesis.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0639.
