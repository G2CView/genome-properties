CC  This genome property (under development) includes a P-type ATPase
CC  copper transporter, a copper response regulatory protein and a copper
CC  chaperone. Copper is a cofactor in some enzymes and is reportedly
CC  essential in all living organisms, but too much copper can be toxic. A
CC  copper response operon may include two copper transporters to achieve
CC  copper homeostatis and include efflux capability. Different copper
CC  transport systems rely on transporters of other types.
