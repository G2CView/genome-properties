CC  Aerobic respiration is the complex series of pathways in which a common
CC  organic intermediate (generally pyruvate) is broken down into carbon
CC  dioxide (CO2) and water (H20) with the concomitant production of ATP in
CC  the presence of oxygen. Pyruvate is generated from glucose via
CC  glycolysis. The first step of this process is conversion of pyruvate to
CC  acetyl-CoA which then enters the Krebs (or, TCA) cycle. Acetyl-CoA may
CC  also be generated independently of pyruvate via the breakdown of other
CC  organic compounds. The TCA cycle generates reducing equivalents in the
CC  form of NADH. NADH, in turn delivers the electrons to the top of the
CC  electron transport chain (oxidative phosphorylation). This chain
CC  results in the pumping of protons (and/or sodium ions) to form a
CC  gradient. Ions flowing back with this gradient power the ATP-generation
CC  machines of the cell. Oxygen acts as the terminal electron acceptor for
CC  the electron-transport chain.
