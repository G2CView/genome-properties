CC  Menaquinone (also known as Vitamin K2) is one of the quinone cofactors
CC  which play an essential role in hydrogen transfer reactions,
CC  particularly during anaerobic respiration. Menaquinone in E. coli and
CC  various other bacteria is synthesized from chorismate, 2-oxoglutarate,
CC  polyprenyl-pyrophosphate and S-adenosylmethionine via SEPHCHC and 
CC  SHCHC intermediates [1,2]. A very similar molecule (phylloquinone, 
CC  vitamin K1) is found in cyanobacteria and plants which contains a 
CC  shorter isoprenoid (phytyl) chain in which three of the four double 
CC  bonds are reduced. In animals, both vitamins K1 and K2 act as 
CC  cofactors for gamma-carboxylation of glutamate (Glu -> Gla) which is 
CC  critical for coagulation factors. Note that an alternative pathway for 
CC  menaquinone biosynthesis (not described by this property) operates in 
CC  Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptomyces, and other 
CC  species [3].
