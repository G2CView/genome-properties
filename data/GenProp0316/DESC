CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. The repeats vary in size from 24 to 48 bp,
CC  interspaced by similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. Variants of
CC  CRISP/Cas loci (subtypes) have been described [2] in which certain 
CC  groups of subtype-specific genes are found in addition to 
CC  characteristic sets of the more widely distributed cas genes. These
CC  subtype-specific genes are found proximal to the cas core genes and the
CC  CRISPR repeats. Unlike these, the set of CRISPR-associated genes
CC  represented here are always found in in genomes which also contain
CC  CRISPRs, but may be located at a remote site on the genome from the
CC  core genes and repeats. Several of these genes belong to the RAMP
CC  (Repeat-Associated Mystery Protein) family, so this 6-gene cassette is
CC  called the CRISPR RAMP module.
