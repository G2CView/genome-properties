DC  Lipid-A-precursor biosynthesis
DR  MetaCyc; NAGLIPASYN-PWY;
CC  Lipid A is a component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of
CC  most gram-negative bacteria. It is one of three regions of bacterial
CC  lipopolysaccharide (LPS), along with the oligosaccharide core and the
CC  repeating O-antigen. In some strains, O-antigen may be missing and the
CC  lipid A-containing material may be designated lipooligosaccharide
CC  (LOS). Lipid A consists of a disaccharide (often
CC  beta-D-GlcN-(1-->6)-D-GlcN) with four attached acyl groups. Lipid A is
CC  attached to a 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KDO), a sugar moeity
CC  that becomes part of the LPS oligosaccharide inner core. Two of the acyl
CC  groups of lipid A are then modified by further acylations into branched
CC  structures; acylation varies somewhat by species, and sometimes
CC  according to conditions within a species. The inner core typically
CC  contains at least two KDO and two heptose residues. The outer core and
CC  O-antigen regions are far more variable, and their biosynthesis is
CC  modeled in this property. LPS biosynthesis mutational studies have
CC  shown that in a number of species, lipid A with two KDO residues but
CC  no additional residues of the inner core, is the minimum required form
CC  of LPS for viability, called Re LPS or Re endotoxin. This genome
CC  property describes a set of well-conserved enzymes for the biosynthesis 
CC  of KDO(2)-lipid A that resembles, but is not necessarily identical to 
CC  (nor as active in endotoxin assays as), the Re endotoxin of E. coli, as 
CC  well as a transporter (or flippase) responsible in most Proteobacteria 
CC  for positioning lipid A in the outer membrane.
**  Note: KdtA adds both first and second KDO.  Also, adding lauroyl and
**  myristoyl groups to convert two acyl groups to branched acyloxyacyl
**  groups happens after KDO addition: KDO(2)-lipid IV(A) is made and
**  converted to KDO(2)-lipid A.  htrB encodes the lauroyl transferase 
**  msbB acylates (Kdo)2-(lauroyl)-lipid IVA.  Note: just added LptA, but
**  need to add LptB.
