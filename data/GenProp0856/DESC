CC  Bacteriorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump with a covelently bound
CC  cofactor, retinal, derived from beta-carotene. Phototrophic bacteria
CC  may have several bacterio-opsin homologs. The protein Blh has been
CC  shown to be a monooxygenase, EC 1.13.11.63, that creates two retinal
CC  molecules from oxygen and one beta-carotene. This property describes
CC  light energy-capturing systems with these components.
