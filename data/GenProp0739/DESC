CC  The heteromeric complex of CsdA and CsdE plays a role in iron-sulfur
CC  (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis, as do the better-known systems ISC, SUF,
CC  and NIF. CdsA, a homolog of SufS, IscS, and NifS, is a cysteine
CC  desulfurase catalytic subunit. CdsE, a SufE homolog, physically
CC  interacts and accepts a sulfur at Cys-61 (numbered as in Escherichia
CC  coli). In contrast to sulfur-accepting components such as NifU and
CC  IscU, CsdE does not bind iron and is not viewed as a scaffold on which
CC  Fe-S cluster biosynthesis can be completed prior to transfer to other
CC  proteins. Rather, the simplicity of this system may reflect a limited
CC  role for the maturation of specific Fe-S cluster-containing proteins. 
**  such as quinolinate synthetase, NadA, they say. That is, maybe
**  S-donation is enough because the target protein itself is the scaffold.
