CC  Most genomes in which the set of three tandemly-encoded genes for the
CC  ATP-binding cassette (ABC) exporter complex similar to the DevBCA
CC  complex of Anabaena are Cyanobacteria capable of heterocyst formation.
CC  Roughly every tenth cell in colonies of certain species of
CC  cyanobacteria differentiate into heterocysts under conditions of
CC  nitrogen starvation, with a loss of CO2 fixation, reduction of O2
CC  permeability, and development of the ability to fix nitrogen. The
CC  DevBCA transporter most likely acts by exporting a glycolipid (or an
CC  enzyme) specific to heterocyst formation.
