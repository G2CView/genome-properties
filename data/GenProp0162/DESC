CC  The branched amino acid isoleucine is biosynthesized from the central
CC  intermediary metabolite pyruvate and the amino acid threonine via a
CC  five step pathway. Four enzymes in this pathway are common to the
CC  pathways for the biosynthesis of leucine and valine, although
CC  specialized versions of these enzymes may exist in certain species
CC  which have a narrowed substrate range or amino acid-specific regulatory
CC  mechanisms. Unlike those other two pathways in which two molecules of
CC  pyruvate are condensed, here threonine is converted first to
CC  2-oxobutyrate and then condensed with pyruvate. Thus, the enzymes
CC  common to the pathways are acting on distinct substrates. 
CC  2-oxobutyrate for this pathway may also be generated by a separate path
CC  from glutamate via mesaconate in certain organisms. The penultimate
CC  intermediate in this pathway, 2-oxo-3-methylvalerate may also be
CC  incorporated into branched-chain fatty acids
**  Evidence for step 3 is also used for GP0163 and GP0164.
**  Evidence for step 5 is also used for GP0163 and GP0164.
