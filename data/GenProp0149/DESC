CC  The reduction of sulfate to sulfide in sulfate assimilatory prokaryotes
CC  is initiated by the activation of sulfate in an adenylation reaction
CC  catalyzed by sulfate adenylyltransferase. The product, 
CC  5-adenylylsulfate (APS), is either directly reduced by a
CC  thioredoxin-dependent APS reductase to sulfite (in a reaction similar
CC  to that found in sulfate dissimilators and plants) or phosphorylated to
CC  the intermediate, 3-phosphoadenylylsulfate (PAPS). The latter is then
CC  reduced by a thioredoxin-dependent PAPS reductase to sulfite. The
CC  sulfite product from either branch of the assimilation pathway is
CC  enzymatically reduced by sulfite reductase to sulfide for incorporation 
CC  into an amino acid acceptor, peptide, or protein[1].
