CC  Involved in electron transport during anaerobic respiration: electrons
CC  are passed from formate dehydrogenase-N (Fdh-N) complex to nitrate
CC  reductase (NarGHI, CPX-1974) complex via a quinone-quinol
CC  (hydroquinone) redox reaction. The molybdopterin cofactor Mo-bisMGD
CC  receives electrons from formate, passes them down a Fe-S cluster chain
CC  to the periplasmic heme, from there to the cytoplasmic heme from where
CC  it is transferred to quinone on FdnH. Quinol transports the electrons
CC  to the NarGHI complex. The collaboration of these two complexes
CC  contributes to the proton motive force: electrons are ultimately
CC  donated to Fdh-N by formate in the periplasm, transported to the
CC  cytoplasm and accepted by nitrate. Hydrogen ions are transported in the
CC  opposite direction: Quinone is reduced to quinol by cytoplasmic protons
CC  which are in turn released into the periplasm when quinol is oxidized
CC  to quinone.
