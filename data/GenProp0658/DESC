CC  Cellulose, a homopolymer of glucose featuring uniform beta-1,4
CC  linkages, is synthesized in bacteria by cellulose synthase [1,2].
CC  Bacterial cellulose may have further modifications such as acetylation.
CC  The synthase consists of two subunits (or domains in the frequent cases
CC  where it is encoded as a single polypeptide), a catalytic domain and
CC  regulatory domain which binds the allosteric activator cyclic-di-GMP.
CC  The protein is membrane-embedded and probably assembles into multimers
CC  such that the individual cellulose strands can self-assemble into
CC  multi-strand fibrils. The purpose of the endoglucanase which is always
CC  present in the same operon with the synthase is not known. Control of
CC  the levels of c-diGMP is via pppGpG cyclases and c-diGMP and pGpG
CC  phosphodiesterases. All genomes expressing this system have numerous
CC  cyclase and phosphodiesterase domain proteins and multiple regulatory
CC  circuits are possible. In E. coli strains, at least three regulatory
CC  systems are indicated [3], whose genes typically are not clustered with
CC  the biosynthetic genes. 
**  galU, UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, WAS a part of this
**  property but was giving disastrous over-hitting.  REMOVED for clarity.
**  Diguanylate cyclases (GMPcyc) and cyclic diguanylate phosphodiesterase
**  (cdiGase) may have same trouble - though they never step_ev_link - I
**  remove them too. Perhaps reintroduce later by clustering or profiles. 
**  OLD PRIVATE COMMENT: How general is the allosteric regulatory control
**  by cyclic-di-GMP?  Look for cyclases of the GGDEF family and
**  phosphodiesterases.
