CC  Tripartite, ATP-dependent efflux pump spanning the entire cell membrane
CC  system. Confers resistance to antibiotics and other toxins
CC  (specifically macrolide compounds containing 14- and 15-membered
CC  lactones) by transporting them out of the bacterial cell. MacB is the
CC  dimeric, non-canonical ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter subunit
CC  containing 4 transmembrane domains which span the entire inner
CC  membrane, an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain, and a central
CC  hydrophilic periplasmic domain. It binds to the periplasmic membrane
CC  fusion protein MacA. Whether it also binds directly to TolC is unclear
CC  (EBI-6305934 shows a very weak reaction). MacA is hexameric and binds
CC  directly to MacB and TolC facilitating direct channelling of toxins out
CC  of the cell. It consists of an alpha-helical, TolC-binding barrel
CC  domain, an intermediate lipyl domain, and a beta-barrel domain which is
CC  the likely MacB binding domain. It may also have a plasma membrane
CC  binding domain (through its N and C termini), but does not bind
CC  directly to the outer membrane. It appears to enhance the ATPase
CC  activity of MacB. TolC is trimeric and has two major domains, a
CC  transmembrane beta-barrel spanning the entire outer membrane, and an
CC  alpha-helical periplasmic barrel domain through which it binds to
CC  MacA. MacA and TolC appear to interact allosterically in a tip-to-tip
CC  fashion through the 'cogwheel' alpha-hairpin tip regions of both
CC  complexes.
