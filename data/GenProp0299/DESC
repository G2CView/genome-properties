CC  The formation of fatty acids (any of the aliphatic monocarboxylic acids 
CC  that can be liberated by hydrolysis from naturally occurring fats and oils)
CC  from simpler components. Fatty acids are predominantly straight-chain acids 
CC  of 4 to 24 carbon atoms, which may be saturated or unsaturated. Branched 
CC  fatty acids and hydroxy fatty acids also occur, and very long chain acids 
CC  of over 30 carbons are found in waxes.
