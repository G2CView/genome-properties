CC  This Genome Property describes the set of Nus factors NusA, NusB, and
CC  NusG, as well as ribosomal protein S10 which is known as NusE. The name
CC  Nus, for N-utilization substance, reflects the phenomenology of
CC  exploitation of N factors for phage lambda in Escherichia coli. Much of
CC  the literature of these transcription termination/anti-termination
CC  factors revolves around the interaction with the transcription
CC  termination factor Rho, but factor Rho and cis-acting Rho-utilization
CC  sites are less well distributed than the N-factors, which are
CC  essentially universal in bacteria. In species with Rho, Nus factors
CC  improve transcriptase turnover speeds. Nus factors can block Rho
CC  action, a process called anti-termination [1]. See GenProp0812 for
CC  Rho-dependent transcription termination.
**  Evidence for step 4 is also used for GP0799.
**  Evidence for step 5 is also used for GP0175 and GP0799.
