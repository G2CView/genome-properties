CC  Catalyzes the reversible oxidation of hydrogen (H2) to protons and
CC  electrons. Maximally produced during fermentation and under various
CC  types of stress such as carbon and phosphate starvation, osmotic up
CC  shift, and stationary phase conditions. Hydrogenase-1 is oxygen
CC  tolerant and contains the special proximal (relative to the active
CC  site) [Fe4S3] cluster that can rapidly undergo two successive
CC  one-electron oxidations within a narrow potential range. The additional
CC  two electrons required to reduce the attacking O2 to two water
CC  molecules, can originate from either the two-electron oxidation of
CC  Ni(I) to Ni(III), or the one-electron oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) at
CC  the active site, the latter coupled to the one-electron oxidation of
CC  the [Fe4S4] medial cluster.
