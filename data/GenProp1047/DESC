CC  The E. coli O101 antigen repeating unit is reported to consist of a
CC  linear dimer with the structure: [->6)aDGlcNAc(1->4)aDGalNAc(1->] [1].
CC  Unlike most E. coli O-antigen biosynthesis clusters, the genes
CC  responsible for O101 in strain B41 are not found adjacent to the
CC  histidine biosynthesis operon. Bounded by a second copy of the GalF
CC  gene and an IS4 transposase also found in the vicinity of the His
CC  operon, this cluster may have shifted out of the normal place by
CC  homologous recombination. Adjacent to the His operon is now found an
CC  apparent transposon-disrupted relict of the O9a cluster and a probably
CC  functional K30 cluster, both closely related to the E69 strain.    The
CC  O101 cluster has an analagous structure to the O8 and O9 antigens,
CC  containing an ABC-type O-antigen transport system and a methylase
CC  presumably acting as a chain length determinant. Despite the simplicity
CC  of the repeat pattern, the O101 cluster contains four
CC  glycosyltransferases, two of them twice the length of typical enzymes.
CC  These likely carry out priming, patterning and scaffolding roles.
