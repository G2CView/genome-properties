CC  Plays a key role in both pyrimidine and arginine biosynthesis by
CC  catalyzing the production of carbamoyl phosphate from one molecule of
CC  bicarbonate, two molecules of MgATP, and one molecule of glutamine.
CC  Consists of two polypeptide chains referred to as the small and large
CC  subunits, which contain a total of three separate active sites that are
CC  connected by an intramolecular tunnel. The small subunit harbors one of
CC  these active sites and is responsible for the hydrolysis of glutamine
CC  to glutamate and ammonia. The large subunit binds the two required
CC  molecules of MgATP and is involved in assembling the final product.
CC  Compounds such as L-ornithine, UMP, and IMP allosterically regulate the
CC  enzyme.
