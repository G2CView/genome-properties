RT  The energy conserving methyltetrahydromethanopterin:coenzyme M
RT  methyltransferase complex from methanogenic archaea: function of the
RT  subunit MtrH.

RL  FEBS Lett. 1999;449:165-168.
CC  This complex of eight subunits, MtrA-H, effects the transfer of a
CC  methyl group from tetrahydromethanopterin to coenzyme M using a
CC  cobalamin (B12) cofactor residing on MtrA. This transfer is coupled to
CC  an energy-driven sodium-ion pump. Methane is subsequently released by
CC  a two-electron reduction of the methyl-coenzyme M by the enzyme
CC  methyl-coenzyme M reductase.
