RT  Very short patch repair: reducing the cost of cytosine methylation.
RA  Lieb M, Bhagwat AS;
RL  Mol Microbiol. 1996;20:467-473.
CC  Very short patch (VSP) repair is a repair system that recognizes
CC  mismatches caused by deamination of 5-methylcytosine (5meC). Cytosine
CC  is modified to 5meC by the product of the dcm gene. Vsr is an
CC  endonuclease that creates a nick to allow the repair. In Escherichia
CC  coli, the second C of the DNA motif CCWGG (where W is A or T) is
CC  methylated; deamination yields T:G mispairs reccognized by the vsr gene
CC  product. The vsr gene typically is found very close to the dcm gene,
CC  and is essentially restricted to a subset of those genomes that carry
CC  dcm.
