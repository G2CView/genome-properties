CC  This property features a radical SAM/SPASM domain peptide maturase
CC  that, in multiple strains of Clostridium botulinum, is next to a tandem
CC  array of seven target peptides, all Cys-rich. This system also occurs
CC  in Clostridium sporogenes, and an array of six peptides occurs in
CC  Thermoanaerobacter italicus Ab9. Clostridium cellulovorans 743B has a
CC  matching radical SAM maturase, but a single weak candidate target
CC  sequence, MKFVKAPTKNISIIKCPYFCNTFFPILPPTF.
**  Neighboring genes in Clostridium botulinum that are likely to part of
**  the system include a pair of GNAT family acetyltransferases, a probable
**  protease, and a transporter.
