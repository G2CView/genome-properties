CC  The tRNA for Gln is produced, in different species, in two different
CC  ways. In some bacteria (including E. coli) and in the eukaryotic
CC  cytosol, the tRNA for glutamine is charged with glutamine. In the
CC  majority of sequenced prokaryotes however, tRNA(gln) initially is
CC  mischarged with glutamate (Glu). Glu is subsequently amidated to Gln
CC  while on the tRNA(gln), as by GatABC in Bacillus subtilis, resulting in
CC  Gln biosynthesis from Glu as well as tRNA aminoacylation. This property
CC  describes the pathway of direct Gln--tRNA ligase activity, performed by
CC  a single protein, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase.
**  Different Gat systems in bacteria and archaea - I think the archaeal
**  gatABC homologs in archaea are Asn instead of Gln, and a GatDE system
**  operates (so gatABC) 
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0258.
