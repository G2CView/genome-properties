CC  Type I restriction endonucleases are components of prokaryotic DNA 
CC  restriction-modification mechanisms that protects the organism against 
CC  invading foreign DNA. Type I enzymes have three different subunits subunits, 
CC  M (modification), S (specificity), and R (restriction), that form 
CC  multifunctional enzymes with restriction, methylase, and ATPase activities 
CC  [1,2].
**  According to notes in PF01420:  one DNA specificity (S) domain  two
