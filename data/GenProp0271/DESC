CC  This system consists of three components, typically in a single operon.
CC  First is a PTS system transporter by which trehalose enters the cell as 
CC  trehalose-6-phosphate. Second is trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase, or 
CC  alpha,alpha-phosphotrehalase. Third is a transcriptional repressor for 
CC  the operon, with different families in E.coli and Bacillus. 
**  no comment yet on whether a TreA should be part of this, make
**  trehalose-6-P from trehalose.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0119.
