CC  The E. coli O121 antigen monomer is a linear tetrasaccharide with the
CC  structure
CC  [->3)bDQui4NGlyAc(1->4)aDGalNAcAN(1->4)aDGalNAcA(1->3)aDGlcNAc(1->]. 
CC  The 4-aminoquinovose sugar is also known as viosamine and the NGlyAc is
CC  an acetylglycylamido group; GalNAcA is N-acetylgalturonic acid, and
CC  GalNAcAN is N-acetylgalacturonamide. Additionally, the DGalNAcAN is
CC  reported to be 60% O-acetylated at the 3-position. Three
CC  glycosyltransferases are present in the sequenced O121(Ec) cluster,
CC  WbqEHI. WbqI shares 47% identity with the WfaH enzyme from the O138(Ec)
CC  antigen cluster, and O138 shares the [DGlcNAc-a-1,3-DGalNAcA] reaction.
CC  WbqE shares 37% identity with WfbE from the O123(Ec) antigen cluster,
CC  and O123 also includes a 4-substituted quinovose sugar in the first
CC  position of the monomer, although the incorporated amino acid is
CC  alanine instead of glycine. By process of elimination, the WbqH enzyme
CC  is assigned to the middle linkage. The N-acetylgalacturonamide is
CC  likely derived from N-acetylgalturonic acid by the action of the
CC  asparagine synthase homolog WbqG. The O-acetylation is likely carried
CC  out by WbqF.
