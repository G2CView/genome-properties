CC  The O76(Ec) antigen is currently only known from its antibody reaction,
CC  no information about the monomer structure or the genes involved is
CC  found in the literature. Genomic information from O76(Ec)-antigen
CC  regions sequenced at JCVI (ostec16 and gstec07) provides the basis for
CC  this property. From this data we postulate that the antigen is
CC  assembled using the wzx/wzy/wzz system, and consistent with this
CC  mechanism the three glycosyltransferases present in the locus suggest
CC  that there are at least three distinct linkages and at least four
CC  sugars in the repeating monomer unit. The sugar composition of the
CC  antigen can be guessed at since the locus appear to lack any extra
CC  sugar biosynthesis genes beyond those converting UDP-glucose to
CC  UDP-galactose and a single putative acetyltransferase. Additionally,
CC  two of the glycosyltransferases show homology to transferases
CC  associated with the O128(Ec) (GT-1), and the O86(Ec) and O127(Ec)
CC  antigens (GT-3). Each of these is composed entirely of L-fucose and
CC  D-galactose residues (or their N-acetylated forms). L-fucose is not
CC  bioavailable in E. coli without the presence of specialized genes for
CC  its biosynthesis, and these are nearly always present in the O-antigen
CC  locus when needed. Taken together, we postulate that the O76(Ec)
CC  antigen monomer is composed primarily if not exclusively of D-Gal and
CC  D-GalNAc residues.
**  Evidence for step 5 is also used for GP0143, GP1035 and GP1036.
