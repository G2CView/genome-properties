RT  Identification of an archaeal 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase catalyzing
RT  reactions involved in coenzyme biosynthesis in methanoarchaea.

RL  J Bacteriol. 2000;182:3688-3692.
CC  This pathway represents the first three steps in coenzyme M
CC  biosynthesis as it occurs in Methanococcus jannaschii. Alternative
CC  pathway to sulfopyruvate, from L-phosphoserine via L-cysteate, has been
CC  described in Methanosarcina acetivorans.
**  Both rules for ComA (TIGR03849, BGRB:2692) are likely to be a bit too
**  narrow, as a cost for avoiding false-positives.
