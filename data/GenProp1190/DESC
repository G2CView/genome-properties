CC  The UvrBC excinuclease repair complex is part of the UvrABC repair
CC  system that catalyzes the recognition and processing of DNA lesions. It
CC  scans the DNA for abnormalities. Upon binding of the UvrAB complex
CC  (CPX-2151) to a putative damaged site, the DNA wraps around one of the
CC  UvrB subunits. DNA wrapping is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and
CC  probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion
CC  of a UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one
CC  DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA
CC  subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision complex (CPX-2152) is
CC  formed. This complex is subsequently bound by UvrC and one of the UvrB
CC  monomers is released. UvrC incises both the 5' and 3' sides of the
CC  lesion. The N-terminal half is responsible for the 3' incision and the
CC  C-terminal half is responsible for the 5' incision.
