CC  The partner protein belongs to a family in which characterized members
CC  are the substrate specificity-conferring (often interchangeable) module
CC  of energy coupling factor (ECF)-type transporters. Two ATP-binding
CC  cassette proteins and the T component (see PF02361) provide the rest of
CC  the transport system. The radical SAM protein is uncharacterized but is
CC  likely to modify what the ECF system imports.
**  TIGR04002 looks like an ECF transporter S component for vitamin import.
**  ZP_03780100.1 and homologs, the biggest family consistently nearby,
**  resembles ThiD and also a  PdxY/PdxK homolog. SUGGESTION - The GenProp
**  pair imports a vitamin salvage precursor. The rSAM advances it (but can
**  exist even without the import). The ThiD homolog further activates it.
**  I HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW RADICAL SAM ACTIVITY FOR COFACTOR SALVAGE IN
**  ANAEROBES (most gut, one molasses sludge digester), probably acting on
**  a salvaged thiamine precursor. rSAM enzyme TIGR04100 is a sub-clade of
**  TIGR04038 (tadD-assoc).
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP1094 (IPR023812).
