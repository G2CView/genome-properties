CC  A proteasome-like degradation complex with two functional subunits: the
CC  HslU hexamer forms the ATPase subunit which has chaperone activity and
CC  the HslV duodecamer forms the protease subunit. The binding of ATP and
CC  its subsequent hydrolysis by HslU are essential for unfolding of
CC  protein substrates subsequently hydrolyzed by HslV. HslU recognizes the
CC  N-terminal part of its protein substrates and unfolds these before they
CC  are guided to HslV for hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis causes a
CC  conformational change in the HslU subunit 'closing' the central pore
CC  and 'un-docking' the ATPase unit from the protease by way of flicking
CC  the HslU C terminus from the HslV-HslV interface into the HslU-HslU
CC  interface. The complex has been shown to be involved in the specific
CC  degradation of heat shock induced transcription factors such as RpoH
CC  and SulA. In addition, small hydrophobic peptides are also hydrolyzed
CC  by HslV. HslV has weak protease activity even in the absence of HslU,
CC  but this activity is induced more than 100-fold in the presence of
CC  HslU. Owing to the size of the central pore of both subunits HslV is
CC  not believed to degrade folded proteins.
