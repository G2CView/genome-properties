CC  This system consists of a lysyl-tRNA ligase homolog and a lysine
CC  2,3-aminomutase homolog frequently encoded next to elongation factor P
CC  in bacteria and responsible for post-translational modification.
**  A lysine, and maybe a spermide, added to a lysine. In euks, the site is
**  hypusine. Some of the lysine 2,3-aminomutase models may be too finely
**  split, too narrow in scope. Additional hydroxylation of EF-P at the
**  same lysine residue by the YfcM protein.
