CC  Plasmids and second chromosomes in the alpha-proteobacteria, that is
CC  replicons other than main chromosome, are often maintained by repABC
CC  systems (an example of an alternative system is replicator region type
CC  A). RepA and RepB are partitioning proteins, while RepC is a
CC  replication protein. In species with multiple plasmids, different
CC  classes of repABC system work in parallel; it appears that the
CC  incompatability system that separates the different RepABC subtypes is
CC  mediated by an untranslated RNA gene, IncA, encoded between repB and
CC  repC and transcribed in the antisense direction [1]. IncA is not 
CC  modelled as part of this Genome Property. Note that homologs to RepA 
CC  and RepB occur as gene pairs in smaller replicons outside the 
CC  alpha-proteobacteria, such as on the smaller chromosome of Vibrio 
CC  cholerae (a gamma-proteobacterium). These more distantly related
CC  systems, however, fall outside the definition of repABC systems as
CC  adapted here from literature.
**  NOTE: accidentally removed Vibrio wings of the model, despite starting
**  from gvc by PPP, but that is OK, definintion here fits only
**  alpha-Proteos. Related properties probably needed for related systems. 
**  This property USED TO BE TIGR00180 as generalized RepB, and PF01656 by
**  HMM-CLUST as a way to tease out the RepA, and existed to try to make a
**  RepA model. This strategy has been abandoned, in favor of a partial
**  phylogenetic profiling approach, from gvc and gbr for genomes with
**  multiple replicons. This gives a much narrower RepA clade, so the
**  pairing TIGR00180/PF01656 is becoming an unused thing, maybe to need a
**  new property.
**  Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium meliloti are synonyms.
