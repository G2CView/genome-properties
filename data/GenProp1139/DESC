CC  Plays a role in chemotaxis, the movement toward or away from chemicals.
CC  The flagellar motor of bacteria is a rotary device energized by the
CC  membrane ion gradient and the complex is required for the rotation and
CC  directional switching of the flagellum and also functions in flagellar
CC  assembly. Motor torque is produced at the top of the switch complex,
CC  where the FliG C-terminal domain bears several conserved charged
CC  residues that interact with charged groups of the stator protein MotA
CC  (P09348). The directionality of the rotation is determined by binding
CC  of CheY-P to the lower part of the C-ring which switches the
CC  directionality from counter-clockwise to clockwise. The CheY-CheZ
CC  complex enhances the dephosphorylation rate of P-CheY. This
CC  dephosphorylation reduces the binding of CheY to the switch and ensures
CC  rapid locomotor responses to changes in the supply of signaling
CC  phosphoryl groups to CheY, thus enabling a continuous response to
CC  environmental changes.
