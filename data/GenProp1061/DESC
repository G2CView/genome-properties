CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats. The repeats vary in size from 24 to 48 bp,
CC  interspaced by similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. These spacers
CC  often are derived from phage and other exogenous DNA, are transcribed
CC  into RNA, and confer resistance to those same phage. Several
CC  CRISPR-associated sequences (cas genes) are nearly as widespread as
CC  CRISPR itself and nearly always are found near repeat loci. Others
CC  represent minor cas genes that serve as markers for specific subtypes
CC  of CRISPR/cas system, each with characteristic cas gene makeup, repeat
CC  structure, and spacer length. The PreFran subtype is found in multiple
CC  reference genomes of Prevotella and Francisella, and found also in
CC  several additional species. It has a single long protein, Cpf1 (Cas
CC  protein 1 of PreFran subtype), in addition to Cas4, Cas1, and Cas2. The
CC  typical repeat has length 36.
