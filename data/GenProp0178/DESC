CC  The glycine cleavage system (GCS), also known as the glycine
CC  decarboxylase system (GDC) consists of a set of four enzymes,
CC  which are involved in a multi-step reaction to catalyse the 
CC  cleavage of glycine molecules. The constituents enzymes are, P
CC  protein, H protein, T protein, and L protein (dihydrolipoamide 
CC  dehydrogenase)[1]. 
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0630.
