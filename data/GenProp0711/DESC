CC  Catechol is an intermediate in the degradation of a number of 
CC  aromatic compounds, including benzoate. Cleavage of the catechol 
CC  ring can occur either by the ortho- or the meta-cleavage pathways. 
CC  This property describes the initial steps in the ortho-cleavage 
CC  pathway. Catechol is cleaved between two ring hydroxyls by catechol 
CC  1,2-dioxygenase (catA) to produce cis,cis-muconate.  cis,cis-muconate 
CC  is then metabolised (via the three steps catB, catC and catD) to form 
CC  3-oxoadipate (the end-point of this upper part of the pathway)[1].
**  57271 : all should have this. DHH. Note that catD could be moved from
**  upper pathways of both this property and protocatechuate to lower
**  pathway, beta-ketoadipate, 57271.
**  Evidence for step 4 is also used for GP0273 (IPR026968).
