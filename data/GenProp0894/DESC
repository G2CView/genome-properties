CC  This Genome Property describes a three-gene cassette common among the
CC  Actinobacteria. The system includes a putative kinase (similar to
CC  phosphatidylinositol kinase), a putative phosphomutase (similar to
CC  phosphoglycerate mutase), and an uncharacterized protein.
**  There was some link between this system and F420, I believe, though it
**  may have been weak.
