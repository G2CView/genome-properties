CC  This property describes a copper resistance (or copper homeostasis)
CC  system. The CopA/CopB pair has been shown in Xanthomonas axonopodis
CC  pathovar citri to be necessary for copper resistance. The CopC/CopD
CC  pair, occasionally found fused, has been implicated in copper
CC  resistance in some species, copper uptake in others. These two pairs
CC  commonly occur independently but occasionally occur together. CopS and
CC  CopR are copper-sensing histidine kinase and DNA-binding response
CC  regulator.
