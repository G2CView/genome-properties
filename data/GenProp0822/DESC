CC  Poly(gamma-glutamic acid) (PGA) is an extracellular structural polymer
CC  found Bacillus subtilis and a number of other species. Differences in
CC  stereochemistry are reported, with poly-(gamma-D-glutamate) in Bacillus
CC  anthracis but a mixture of D- and L-glutamates in Bacillus subtilis
CC  168, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, and Bacillus licheniformis
CC  ATCC 14580. Because the gene symbol pgsA (nomenclature from Bacillus
CC  subtilis natto) refers to a different gene in Bacillus subtilis 168, we
CC  will use instead capB (pgsB, ywsC), capC (pgsC, ywtA), capA (pgsA,
CC  ywtB), etc. This property describes only the biosynthesis (PgsB and
CC  PgsC), and not the export or attachment machinery that differs between
CC  Gram-positive and Gram-negative systems, and between capsule-forming
CC  and secretory forms of system.
**  anchored in B. anthracis but not others.  BEWARE GO troubles! The
**  capsule made is NOT polysaccharide.  Based on my request, there is now
**  a GO term: capsule poly-gamma-glutamate biosynthetic process GO:0070502
