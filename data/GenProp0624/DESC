CC  Several different types of enzyme complex are designated sulfite
CC  reductase, and each may resemble some enzyme with differing specificity
CC  more closely than they resemble each other. This property represents a
CC  bacterial three subunit type as found in several species of Clostridium
CC  and in Salmonella. In Salmonella, it is described as a
CC  siroheme-containing sulfite reductase, reversibly inhibited by oxygen,
CC  that can produce H2S from sulfite under anaerobic conditions when
CC  provided with a fermentable sugar. 
**  Ability of this enzyme to make H2S from sulfite is described as
**  incidentally making sulfur available in CysI and CysJ mutants in
**  Salmonella (H2S is more commonly made from thiosulfate).
