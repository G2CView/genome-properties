CC  This seven-gene operon described in E. coli K-12 [1] is responsible for
CC  the degradation of uracil, and to a lesser extent, thymine. This has
CC  been determined by growth and mutation experiments. The operon contains
CC  a luciferase family member (RutA) which likely catalyzes the
CC  FMN-dependent critical oxidation for the ring opening as well as RutF
CC  which may be involved in recycling the FMN cofactor. Other seemingly
CC  essential components are an isochorismate mutase family protein (RutB),
CC  a hydrolase (RutD) and a member of the L-PSP endoribonuclease family
CC  (RutC) and a regulatory protein (RutR). The transporter RutG found in
CC  E. coli is not found in all genomes harboring the rest of the operon
CC  and may be replaced by other non-homologous transporters located
CC  elsewhere in the genomes.  This property appears to be limited to the
CC  alpha and gamma proteobacteria.
