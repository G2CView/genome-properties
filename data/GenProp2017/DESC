CC  Gamma secretase is a complex found in cell membranes and initially
CC  identified as the peptidase responsible for the gamma, varepsilon and 
CC  zeta cleavages of the transmembrane domains of Type I membrane proteins 
CC  including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch.  Release of the 
CC  amyloid beta (A-beta) peptide from APP is an important step in the 
CC  development of Alzheimer's disease and forms the plaques that are 
CC  characteristic of the pathology.  Release of the A-beta peptide requires 
CC  two proteolytic cleavages, cleavage by beta-secretase in the extracellular
CC  domain, and then cleavage at the gamma and epsilon sites by gamma
CC  secretase.  The proteolytic component of gamma secretase is presenilin
CC  which is an aspartic endopeptidase [1].
**  Reference [1] is in press but available electronically.
**  The complex contains either presenilin 1 or presenilin 2.
**  Only the precursors of senilin have proteolytic activity.
