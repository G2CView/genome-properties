CC  dTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose is a precursor of (at least) two
CC  exopolysaccharide components, 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-D-glucose
CC  (D-Qui3NAc), found in the E. coli O5, O65 and O71 antigens (as well as
CC  others), and a variant containing an N-acetyl-L-seryl group in place of
CC  the acetyl observed in the O114 antigen. It is synthesized in the O5
CC  antigen biosynthesis cluster from the common intermediate
CC  4,6-dideoxy-4-oxo-dTDP-D-glucose by the RfbA and RfbB genes. The
CC  pathway to Qui3NAc is parallel to that generating Fuc3NAc from the same
CC  intermediate, utilizing an isomerase (FdtA ~ QdtA), an aminotransferase
CC  (FdtB ~ QdtB) and an acetyltransferase (FdtC ~ QdtC). The two sugars
CC  differ only in the chirality at C4.
