CC  Lysine biosynthesis in fungi has been characterized and begins with the
CC  condensation of 2-oxoglutarate and acetyl-CoA to homocitrate and
CC  continues through the distinctive intermediate, alpha-aminoadipate. 
CC  This pathway is distinct in every respect from the diaminopimelate
CC  pathway commonly found in bacteria and animals.  Recently, an
CC  alpha-aminoadipate pathway closely related to the fungal version has
CC  been characterized in Thermus thermophilus [1] and appears to be widely
CC  distributed among the archaea.
