CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. Jansen, et al. describe CRISPR loci as
CC  having direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by
CC  similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. Variants of CRISP/Cas loci
CC  (subtypes) have been described [2] in which certain groups of 
CC  subtype-specific genes are found in addition to characteristic sets of 
CC  the more widely distributed cas genes. The Ypest subtype, so named 
CC  because this subtype is the only one found in the genome of Yersinia 
CC  pestis, consists of cas1, cas3 and the subtype specific genes csy1-4. 
CC  The cas3 gene of this subtype is sufficiently diverged from the cas3 
CC  gene of other CRISPR subtypes that it is identified by a separate HMM. 
CC  The spacers of these CRISPRs have been analyzed and some have been 
CC  shown to have been captured from extrachromosomal sources [3]. The 
CC  repeats associated with this subtype tend to have a periodicity of 60 
CC  nucleotides. This subtype is found only in the Proteobacteria.
