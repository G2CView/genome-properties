CC  A characteristic four-gene system for arsenic (and antimony) resistance
CC  is found in many prokaryotic genomes. The system includes a pump for
CC  extrusion of arsenite, an arsenate reductase that converts arsenate to
CC  arsenite for transport, a protein ArsH of unknown function that is
CC  sometimes not required, and a regulatory protein. Several distinct
CC  families are known for the arsenate reductase, ArsC, which may be
CC  dependent on glutaredoxin or thioredoxin in different instances.
**  Evidence for step 4 is also used for GP0931 (IPR023485).
