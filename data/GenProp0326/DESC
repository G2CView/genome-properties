CC  This Genome Property describes a proposed protein sorting system
CC  associated with exopolysaccharide loci in many Gram-negative bacteria.
CC  One hallmark is the presence of a paralogous domain at the C-termini of
CC  a substantial number of proteins in a single genome, usually from four
CC  to sixty-five. Features of this domain, described by TIGRFAMs model
CC  TIGR02595, are a conserved motif PEP, a transmembrane domain, and a
CC  cluster of basic residues for a total length of about 24 amino acids.
CC  We  call this domain PEP-CTERM, and note that is shares a number of
CC  properties with the the LPXTG-type Gram-positive cell-wall targeting
CC  sequence. Another hallmark of this system is the presence of one or
CC  more homologs of EpsH (TIGR02602), a highly hydrophobic protein that
CC  spans the membrane eight or more times. Its surrounding genes nearly
CC  always pertain to exopolysaccharide biosynthesis. We have proposed that
CC  TIGR02602 models a transpeptidase that cleaves PEP-CTERM proteins,
CC  attaches them transiently to an active site Cys, then attaches them
CC  covalently to an unknown substrate for sorting to the outer surface of
CC  the cell, closely analogous to the action of sortase in Gram-positive
CC  bacteria. We suggest the name exosortase for EpsH homologs involved in
CC  this process. In Proteobacterial species with a the PEP-CTERM/exsortase
CC  system, a sensor histidine kinase (TIGR02916) and a sigma-54-dependent
CC  DNA-binding response regulator (TIGR02915) are present and appear to
CC  bind a conserved regulatory site found upstream of most PEP-CTERM
CC  genes.
