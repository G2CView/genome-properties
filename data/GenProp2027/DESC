CC  The CatSper complex is a voltage-gated calcium ion channel located 
CC  in the sperm tail [1].  It is required for sperm hypermotility and 
CC  fertility [2, 3].  The complex is a heterotetramer the centre of which 
CC  forms a pore for calcium ions. Two other subunits (delta and epsilon)  
CC  are associated with this complex [4].
