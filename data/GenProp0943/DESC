CC  This property consists of the glycine radical enzyme, pyruvate-formate
CC  lyase (also called formate C-acetyltransferase) and its activating 
CC  enzyme, [Formate-C-acetyltransferase]-activating enzyme. In most 
CC  Proteobacteria, the gene pair is accompanied by the formate channel 
CC  gene FocA. FocA forms a pentameric channel that can
CC  pass formate but not water, and that belongs to the same transporter
CC  family as nitrate transporter NirC.
