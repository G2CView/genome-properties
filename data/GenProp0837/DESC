CC  This two-enzyme pathway for 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate biosynthesis can
CC  replace the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase of E. coli, 
CC  and is more widely distributed. PlsX synthesizes the acylphosphate from 
CC  an acyl group on a carrier (CoA or acyl carrier protein), and PlsY (YgiH, 
CC  YneS) transfers the acyl group to glycerol-3-phosphate.
