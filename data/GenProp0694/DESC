CC  Glucose may be imported into the cell as a carbon source via the
CC  glucose-specific phosphotransferase system (PTS) and converted to the
CC  glycolysis pathway intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the action
CC  of phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) and 6-phosphofructokinase (6-PFK).
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0120.
