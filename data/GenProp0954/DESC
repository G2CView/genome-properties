CC  Pep1357C from Streptococcus thermophilus is a secreted modified peptide
CC  whose 9-amino acid mature form AKGDGWKVM is cyclized between residues 2
CC  (Lys) and 6 (Trp), probably via a dehydrogenation catalyzed by the
CC  adjacent radical SAM enzyme. Similar peptides with the same core
CC  sequence KGDGW and pairing with a radical SAM enzyme occur elsewhere,
CC  such as Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363. The Pep1357C system
CC  probably provides signaling rather than bacteriocin activity.
**  ABC transporter should be added. Protease not identified yet.
