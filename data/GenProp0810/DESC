CC  The protein previously called linocin M18 is now recognized as
CC  encapsulin, a self-assembling protein forming that associates with an
CC  enzyme (typically a peroxidase) and forms a proteinaceous organelle.
CC  Two quite different families, one a peroxidase, the other resembling
CC  ferritins, can be packaged by encapsulin and have a similar C-terminal
CC  motif, resembling DGSL[SGN]IGSL[KR], separated by a disordered region
CC  from their respective core homology regions.
**  Was not a bacteriocin after all. The two known families were known to
**  rely on their tails, which are similar. I was able to find the same
**  tail on heremrythrin-like and on an unknown family, adjacent to the
**  encapsulin.  There could be others. Note: the best new science in this
**  Genome Property is that I built TIGR04537 successfully.  But it does
**  not hit anything in Thermotoga (it should) and may be missing the whole
**  ferritin-like group - needs a twin.
