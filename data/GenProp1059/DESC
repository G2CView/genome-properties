CC  This Genome Property unites models for proteins for some but not all
CC  types of coronavirus. This virus encodes a large polyprotein, over 6000
CC  amino acids, that becomes multiple proteins represented by different
CC  HMMs. 
**  Does not cover bat coronavirus. Let us see what it does cover. MAYBE
**  half done for set of proteins from (avian) Infectious bronchitis virus
