RT  Post-translational modification in microviridin biosynthesis.
RA  Philmus B, Christiansen G, Yoshida WY, Hemscheidt TK;
RL  Chembiochem. 2008;9:3066-3073.
CC  Microviridins, marinostatins, and related peptide natural products
CC  become circularized into tricyclic depsipeptides, and serve as
CC  proteinase inhibitors. Characteristic proteins of their biosynthesis
CC  cassettes include a pair of closely related ATP-grasp proteins.
**  The six described genes are two ATP-grasp (RimK homologs), two targets,
**  and acetyltransferase, and an ABC transporter (single gene?).
