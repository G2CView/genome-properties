CC  This protein-sorting system occurs so far only in the alpha
CC  Proteobacteria. The system is largely dedicated, in the sense that the
CC  presumed substrate is usually one-per-genome and usually adjacent.
CC  Substrates contain the motif (V)PEID and among the smallest of any
CC  proposed exosortase targets. The processing enzyme is an unusual fusion
CC  of an N-terminal exosortase region and a C-terminal region related to
CC  eukaryotic CAAX prenyl proteases and bacterial bacteriocin
CC  self-immunity proteins.
