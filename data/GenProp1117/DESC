CC  Required for replicative synthesis, forming a link between the DNA
CC  polymerase III clamp loader complex (CPX-1926) and the DNA binding
CC  protein tetramer SSB (CPX-1928). This aids in the tethering of the DNA
CC  polymerase III holoenzyme to single-stranded DNA. A further 3
CC  heterodimers co-localise at the replisome and are thought to interact
CC  with other SSB protomers. It is possible that multimers of the gamma
CC  subunit (P06710-2) are linked to the free end of these psi protomers.
CC  The function of these subcomplexes is as yet unknown.
