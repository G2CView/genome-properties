CC  Toxin-antitoxin gene pairs, called addiction modules, are found often
CC  on plasmids but also on the chromosome. These modules can promote
CC  plasmid stability in populations by killing daughter cells that don't
CC  receive a copy of the plasmid during cell division. The phenomenon,
CC  called post-segregational killing, occurs because the antitoxin has a
CC  shorter biological half-life than the toxin. Some chromosomal
CC  toxin-antitoxin gene pairs appear to act in regulation of cellular
CC  processes and are not necessarily selfish genetic elements. The
CC  antitoxin generally is a transcription factor. The toxin may act in
CC  several ways. This addiction module property describes the RelE system,
CC  where RelE acts by cleaving ribosome-associated transcripts.
**  So which transcription factors can act as partners?  antidote RelB -
**  PF04221  
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0321.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0321 and GP0324.
