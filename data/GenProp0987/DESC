CC  This Genome Property describes a uniquely cyanobacterial subclass of
CC  the PEP-CTERM/exosortase system, restricted to but found in nearly
CC  every cyanobacterium outside of Prochlorococcus. The PEP-CTERM variant
CC  is somewhat longer at its C-terminus, with much stronger conservation
CC  throughout the transmembrane region. At leas one of two forms of
CC  cyanobacterial-restricted exosortase (cyanosortase) occurs always
CC  occurs as well, occasionally adjacent to a PEP-CTERM protein.
