CC  This system, which is restricted to a subset of archaea, always
CC  contains a radical SAM enzyme belonging to the peptide maturase
CC  subclass. A small protein encoded nearby in a couple of cases, 
CC  is Cys-rich because of two CXXCG motifs, but that arrangement 
CC  suggests ligand activity rather than post-translational 
CC  modification. 
**  Modification target must not be nearby.
