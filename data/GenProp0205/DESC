CC  The signal recognition system in bacteria includes the signal
CC  recognition particle (SRP) receptor FtsY and the SRP itself, which
CC  consists of a polypeptide (Ffh) and a structural RNA. Also included in
CC  this property are two peptidases. Signal peptidase I cleaves the
CC  standard signal peptide, and differs from the signal peptidase used for
CC  lipoproteins. Signal peptide peptidases are enzymes that degrade the
CC  signal peptides (oligopeptides that may have signaling roles, and also
CC  that may interfere with protein secretion), which are left after 
CC  removal from a nascent protein by some signal peptidase.
