CC  Photosynthesis is defined here as the ability to harness light energy 
CC  to create new organic compounds from water and CO2. Note that some 
CC  bacteria perform anoxygenic photosynthesis (either aerobic or 
CC  anaerobic), an exception to the broadly held view that photosynthesis 
CC  must convert water and CO2 into oxygen and carbohydrate; this can be 
CC  achieved by using a H2S rather than H20 as a source of hydrogen, and 
CC  releasing sulfur or sulfates rather than 02 as waste products. 
CC  Halobacterium is currently regarded as a photoheterotroph that can 
CC  harness light for energy for ion pumps but cannnot synthesize new 
CC  organic compounds from this energy, nor release 02.
