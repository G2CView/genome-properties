CC  Insulin is secreted by the pancreatic beta cells. Its
CC  secretion can be stimulated by the import of glucose
CC  via a surface transporter, and metabolism of glucose
CC  increases intracellular ATP, inhibiting ATP-sensitive
CC  potassium channels, causing an influx of calcium into
CC  the cell [1]. Alternatively, there are surface 
CC  receptors for peptide hormones such as glucagon-like 
CC  peptide 1. Binding triggers an increase in cAMP, 
CC  activation of G proteins [2,3,4], leading to insulin 
CC  secretion via binding of storage vesicles to the 
CC  membrane [2].
**  This Genome Property models the release of insulin
**  stored in vesicles induced by peptide hormones.
**  It is difficult to model the pathway initiated by
**  glucose, because it involves the TCA cycle and
**  it is the increase in ATP that triggers Na+/K+ flux
**  and an increase in intracellular Ca2+. 
**  Part of the pathway induced by peptide hormones 
**  requires de novo synthesis of insulin, so is also
**  difficult to model.
**  G protein is a heterotrimer of alpha, beta and gamma
**  subunits.  The alpha chain has the nucleotide binding 
**  site; beta and gamma are GTPases.
**  Can this pathway can be a separate GenomeProperty for exocytosis?
