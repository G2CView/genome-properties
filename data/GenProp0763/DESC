CC  This property represents one of a number of distinct catabolic pathways
CC  for nicotinate (niacin, vitamin B3), a nine-enzyme anaerobic
CC  fermentation to pyruvate and propionate as in the anaerobic soil
CC  bacterium Eubacterium barkeri. The nicotinate dehydrogenase in E.
CC  barkeri is a four-subunit enzyme with a non-selenocysteine selenium
CC  that belongs to a family of selenium-dependent molybdenum hydroxylases.
**  I have zero models for the nine EC numbers. This will be a BrainGrab
**  pathway, and model for projecting from high-confidence BrainGrab to
**  secondary annotations. Deciding here, against doing the four-subunit
**  first enzyme, nicotinate dehydrogenase, as a separate property.
