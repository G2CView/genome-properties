CC  PABA, or para-aminobenzoic acid biosynthesis, is a precursor for folate
CC  biosynthesis. It is synthesized from the branch point metabolite
CC  chorismate and glutamine. Aminodeoxychorismate synthase component
CC  (6.3.5.8) I is PabA, aminodeoxychorismate synthase component II is
CC  PabB, and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase (4.1.3.38) is PabC.
**  First property since I started with brain_grab. May not use HMMs for
**  all three components. HORRIBLY WAY FAR FROM PUBLIC because there may be
**  lots of little families, all related to some Trp-biosynthesis genes and
**  maybe even some doing double duty.
