CC  The combination of MutS (the MutS1 branch but not the MutS2 branch of
CC  the MutS family) and MutL leads to a general mechanism for mismatch
CC  exision and repair (MMR). Other proteins, recruited by MutS1 and MutL,
CC  act to clip (MutH or other endonuclease), remove (UvrD), and
CC  resynthesize one strand in the region containing the mismatch. MMR
CC  constrasts in its generality with the targeting of specific mismatches
CC  by various base excision repair (BER) glycosylases and with variants of
CC  MMR that act on specific mismatches. In Escherichia coli and related
CC  species that contain the endonuclease MutH and the DNA adenine
CC  methylation protein Dam, lack of methylation marks the newly
CC  synthesized strand; the mismatch is resolved by excision, removal, and
CC  resynthesis of a piece of that strand. MMR is referred to as
CC  methyl-directed mismatch repair in this subset of species with MMR.
**  As of 1999, all species lacking MutL but having a MutS family member
**  have a MutS2 rather than a MutS1. Eisen review.
