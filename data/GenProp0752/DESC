RT  In vitro reconstitution of Mycobacterial ergothioneine biosynthesis.
RA  Seebeck FP;
RL  J Am Chem Soc. 2010;132:6632-6633.
CC  In actinobacteria, ergothioneine biosynthesis begins with EgtD, a
CC  SAM-dependent enzyme that trimethylates the histidine alpha-amino group
CC  to produce hercynine, the histidine-betaine. EgtA gamma-ligates Cys to
CC  Glu, as occurs in glutathione biosynthesis. Next, EgtB attaches
CC  hercynine to gammaglutamyl cysteine, with sulfur attachment to the
CC  histidine-derived ring. EgtC then releases glutamate . Finally, EgtE, a
CC  pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme related to selenocysteine lyase,
CC  cleaves the hercynylcysteine sulfoxide to leave ergothioneine.
CC  Ergothioneine production is known also in cyanobacteria and mushrooms,
CC  and is predicted to be more widely distributed. 
**  June 2012 realized this system is ergothioneine biosynthesis, which is
**  not just bacterial - major in mushrooms. Selenium analog is called
**  selenoneine. Changed name and step_nums. Unfinished: need MSMEG_6246 to
**  become EgtE. Need to hit in mushrooms too.  Hercynine, which is
**  histidine betaine, is a precursor, suggesting the methytransferase does
**  an independent step that might be part also of other properties. 
**  PROBABLY NEED TO PROMOTE EgtC to REQUIRED TO PREVENT CONFUSION WITH
**  SELENONEINE.
