CC  Transcriptional regulator involved in various aspects of molybdenum
CC  metabolism by both limiting molybdate uptake by repressing the
CC  molybdate transporter operon modABCD, and enhancing the transcription
CC  of molybdenum-dependent, and of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis
CC  enzymes. It is activated by the binding of 2 molecules of molybdate to
CC  the dimerization interface. Upon binding of molybdate, the conformation
CC  of the dimer changes, probably enhancing the DNA affinity of the
CC  complex. It recognizes an 8-base inverted repeat 5'-TAACGTTA-3' flanked
CC  by two CAT boxes upstream of the modABCD operon. ModE also interacts
CC  with tungstate.
