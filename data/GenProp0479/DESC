CC  Acetate and acetyl-CoA can be interconverted for a number of purposes
CC  including utilization of acetate as in acetate fermentation, excretion
CC  of acetate in the fermentation of other compounds and the biosynthesis
CC  of acetyl-CoA for other purposes. Several different single-step and
CC  multi-step pathways are summarized in this property. 
**  The state of this property will be YES if any of the component pathways 
**  are found and the value field will hold the number of pathways found.
