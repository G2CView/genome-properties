RT  Bacterial SLH domain proteins are non-covalently anchored to the cell
RT  surface via a conserved mechanism involving wall polysaccharide
RT  pyruvylation.

CC  Two classes of S-layer homology domain (SLH) proteins are S-layer
CC  proteins themselves and porin-like outer membrane proteins with
CC  N-terminal SLH domains. Mesnage, et al. [1] have shown that CsaB (cell
CC  surface anchoring B) in Bacillus anthracis catalyzes a pyruvyl group
CC  addition to an LPS-associated polysaccharide, an addition that enables
CC  non-covalent binding by SLH domain proteins to the cell wall. 
**  We have built the model TIGR03609, representing a special clade within 
CC  the larger family described by Pfam model PF04230, and find that it 
**  tracks closely with the SLH domain in its phylogenetic distribution. 
**  Made the property initially with PF04230 for the pyruvoyl attachment
**  protein, but then working from this Genome Property showed that the
**  family could/should be split.
