RT  Revised model for Enterococcus faecalis fsr quorum-sensing system: the
RT  small open reading frame fsrD encodes the gelatinase
RT  biosynthesis-activating pheromone propeptide corresponding to
RT  staphylococcal agrd.

CC  The four characterized component of the staphylococcal agr system are a
CC  propeptide, a processing enzyme, a histidine kinase (AgrC), and a
CC  response regulator (AgrA). In the related Enterococcus faecalis fsr
CC  system, the propeptide occurs as an extension of the processing enzyme,
CC  may be autoprocessed from it, and may also be independently translated. 
**  SACOL2023 - SACOL2026. In gef, EF_1821 is odd because it is a AgrB with
**  an appendage (AgrD-like, but not very) that it autoprocesses.
