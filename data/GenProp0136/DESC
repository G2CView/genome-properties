CC  Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an electron and hydrogen 
CC  transport cofactor important for aerobic respiration and photosynthesis. 
CC  It is synthesized in bacteria from chorismate and polyprenyl 
CC  pyrophosphates of varying lengths. The pathway is composed of 10 Ubi 
CC  proteins which are named UbiA-I and UbiX. UbiG catalyses two 
CC  O-methylation steps within the pathway, but with different substrates in
CC  each case [1]. UbiB is thought to be involved with the fourth step in the
CC  pathway, catalysed by UbiI [2], but is not included in the pathway 
CC  diagrams. Knock-out of the three hydroxylation steps requiring molecular 
CC  oxygen results in anaerobic synthesis of ubiquinone, indicating the 
CC  presence of an alternative system [3]. In yeast and animals, a different 
CC  pathway exists starting from 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, having latter steps 
CC  in common with the bacterial pathway [4]. In addition to ubiquinone, 
CC  bacteria may contain menaquinone and/or phylloquinone which together make 
CC  up their quinone pool.
