CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. Jansen, et al. describe CRISPR loci as
CC  having direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by
CC  similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. Variants of CRISP/Cas loci
CC  (subtypes) have been described [2] in which certain groups of 
CC  subtype-specific genes are found in addition to characteristic sets of 
CC  the more widely distributed cas genes. The Ecoli subtype, so named 
CC  because this subtype is the only one found in the genome of Escherichia 
CC  coli, consists of cas1-3, a subtype-specific variant of cas5 and the 
CC  subtype specific genes cse1-4. The repeats associated with this subtype 
CC  tend to have a periodicity of 61 nucleotides and a repeat size of 29 
CC  nucleotides. This subtype is found in a wide variety of bacteria and has 
CC  also been reported to be present in an archaeon [3].
