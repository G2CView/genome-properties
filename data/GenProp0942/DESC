CC  This two gene system converts even-numbered saturated and unsaturated
CC  fatty acids (largely C16 and C18) into n-1 odd-numbered alkanes or
CC  alkenes [1].  The most commonly observed alkanes in cyanobacteria,
CC  where this system is found, are heptadecane, pentadecane and
CC  methyl-heptadecane [1].  Fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP)
CC  substrates are first converted to fatty aldehydes by the action of an
CC  NAD(P)H-dependent Acyl-ACP reductase.  This reductase is distantly
CC  related to the short-chain dehydrogenase or reductase (SDR) family
CC  (PF00106).  The fatty aldehyde is subsequently converted to
CC  hydrocarbons by an aldehyde decarbonylase, releasing CO.  This
CC  decarbonylase is distantly related to a family of di-iron-containing
CC  reductases including ribonucleotide reductase.
