CC  This property represents the presence of a characteristic gene pair,
CC  found in large paralogous families in several species of Acidobacteria.
CC  One component is a putative transcriptional regulator related to PadR. 
CC  The other is ADOP, or Acidobacterial duplicated orphan permease, an 
CC  integral membrane protein related to ABC transporter permease 
CC  components such as LolC, MacB, and FtsX, but orphaned in the sense of 
CC  not being found next to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins. The 
CC  function is unknown.
