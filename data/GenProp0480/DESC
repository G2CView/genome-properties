CC  This property's sole component is the enzyme acetyl-CoA ligase which
CC  hydrolyses ATP to AMP in the process of ligating acetate to coenzyme A.
CC   This enzyme acts essentially irreversibly in the direction of AcCoA
CC  biosynthesis and utilizes an enzyme-bound acyl-adeylate (AMP-Ac)
CC  intermediate [1]. The purpose of this property is for comparison with
CC  the various other ways of interconverting acetate and acetyl-CoA.
