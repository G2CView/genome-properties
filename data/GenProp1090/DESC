AU  Haft DH
TH  0
CC  This system consists of XyeA as the precursor peptide for a peptide
CC  post-translational modification system, XyeB as the radical SAM/SPASM
CC  domain peptide maturase, and neighboring cleavage/export proteins.
**  Closest property is the FxS property, which this one was built to
**  support.
