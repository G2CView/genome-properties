CC  The basic amino acid lysine may be synthesized by one of two types of
CC  pathways in prokaryotes, diaminopimelate (DAP) pathways and the 
CC  alpha-aminoadipate (AAA) pathway. DAP pathways have several variants 
CC  including the dehydrogenase (reductive) pathway which requires ammonia 
CC  and NADPH, and the acetylated and succinylated pathways which do not. 
CC  A non-reductive pathway which uses neither acetate or succinate
CC  protecting groups is found in plants but has not been observed in
CC  prokaryotes. The AAA pathway has a variant found in fungi and plants
CC  which has not been observed in prokaryotes.
