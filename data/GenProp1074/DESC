RT  Type V secretion: mechanism(s) of autotransport through the bacterial
RT  outer membrane.

CC  Type V secretion systems (T5SS) are most commonly the classical
CC  monomeric autotransporters (type Va), in which a C-terminal outer
CC  membrane (OM) beta barrel domain functions as a translocator through
CC  the OM for an N-terminal passenger domain of the same polypeptide
CC  chain. Many type Va autotransporters cleave autocatalytically to
CC  release the passenger domain. In type Vb systems, called two-partner
CC  secretion systems, the passenger and translocator domains are in
CC  separate polypeptides. Additional variant forms Vc, Vd, and Ve have
CC  also been described. A special type of signal peptide (PF13018) tethers
CC  the nascent polypeptide chain to the Sec apparatus in some
CC  autotransporters to allow proper completion of C-terminal domain
CC  folding in the OM.
**  So far, no passenger domains, no chaperones, no beta barrel assembly
