RT  in protein folding.

CC  Polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHAs) are high molecular weight carbon and
CC  energy storage molecules. They exist as linear polymers in which the 
CC  monomeric units have the form -[O-CHR(CH2)xCO]-. The aliphatic 
CC  polyesters occur in inclusion bodies in various bacteria and archaea. 
CC  The most common form is polyhydroxybutyric acid, -[0-CHCH3-CH2-CO]-. 
CC  Typical biosynthetic enzymes include ketothiolases, reductases, and 
CC  PHA synthases. Additional proteins may include small PHA inclusion 
CC  body-associated proteins. Typical gene symbols include pha (phb for
CC  polyhydroxybutyrate) A (ketothiolase), B (reductase), C (synthase), Z
CC  (depolymerase), E (second subunit of heterodimeric-type PHA synthase),
CC  R, and Q. It has been reported that all prokaryotes and eukaryotes 
CC  synthesize PHB of medium-chain length (~100â€“200 residues) thats is 
CC  found in lipid bilayers and vesicles, and PHB of short-chain length 
CC  (<12 residues) which is conjugated to proteins in membranes and 
CC  organelles [1]. However, this property refers to very high molecular 
CC  weight (10,000 to >1,000,000 residues) PHAs in granular deposits.
**  Same paper says granules frequently include some R-3-hydroxyvalerate 
**  and other hydroxy-acids, and thus they are often referred to as 
**  polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA).
