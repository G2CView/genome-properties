CC  dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose is an intermediate in the 
CC  biosynthesis of L-rhamnose and D-fucosamine derivatives. L-rhamnose is a 
CC  common component of the bacterial capsule and/or cell wall, and is 
CC  important in bacterial survival during infection. dTDP-L-rhamnose is the 
CC  precursor of L-rhamnose[1,2]. dTDP-L-rhamnose is synthesized from 
CC  glucose-1-phosphate and deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) via a 
CC  four-step enzymatic pathway. The four enzymes are: glucose-1-phosphate 
CC  thymidyltransferase (also known as dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, gene 
CC  name rlmA or rfbA); dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (gene name rmlB or 
CC  rfbB); dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase (also known as 
CC  dTDP-6-deoxy-D-xylo-4-hexulose 3,5-epimerase, gene name rmlC or rfbC); 
CC  and dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase (also known as 
CC  dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase (gene name rmlD or rfbD)[1,2]. 
CC  This property refers to the first two steps of this pathway.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0912 (GUILD).
