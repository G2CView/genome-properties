CC  A sigma factor is a DNA-binding protein that binds to the DNA-directed 
CC  RNA polymerase core, to produce the holoenzyme capable of initiating 
CC  transcription at specific sites. Different sigma factors act in 
CC  vegetative growth, heat shock, extracytoplasmic functions (ECF), etc. 
CC  This model represents the clade of sigma factors called sigma-54, or 
CC  RpoN (unrelated to sigma 70-type factors such as RpoD/SigA). RpoN is
CC  responsible for enhancer-dependent transcription, and its presence
CC  characteristically is associated with varied panels of activators, most
CC  of which are enhancer-binding proteins [1]. RpoN may be responsible for 
CC  transcription of nitrogen fixation genes, flagellins, pilins, etc., and 
CC  synonyms for the gene symbol rpoN, such as ntrA, reflect these observations.
