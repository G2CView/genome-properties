CC  This property describes the formation of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA. 
CC  Fatty acids are any of the aliphatic monocarboxylic acids that can be 
CC  liberated by hydrolysis from naturally occurring fats and oils. Fatty 
CC  acids are predominantly straight-chain acids of 4 to 24 carbon atoms, 
CC  which may be saturated or unsaturated; branched fatty acids and hydroxy 
CC  fatty acids also occur, and very long chain acids of over 30 carbons 
CC  are found in waxes.    
**  I created a separate pathway PlsX/Y, removing PlsX from this property,
**  as putting fatty acid onto glycerol is downstream from this pathway.
**  DHH 12/2008.
