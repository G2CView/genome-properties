CC  In this uncharacterized system, the radical SAM domain protein (see
CC  TIGR04167) has a Cys-rich suffix domain modeled by PF12345. In at least
CC  eight reference genomes, one Cys is replaced by selenocysteine,
CC  suggesting enzymatic activity and a distinctive role. In a large number
CC  of genomes, the radical SAM enzyme is co-clustered with a member of
CC  family TIGR04169.
**  Version 3 of ProPhylo, 151 genomes, about 7.6 percent of genomes when
**  based on selenoSammy. First couple by PPP were 4 to 5 gene
**  neighborhoods, well-separated, but halves of larger families. Adding
**  two additional families, glycosyltransferases, one like CofC, one like
**  MftF (mycofactocin).
