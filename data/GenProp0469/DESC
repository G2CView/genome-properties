CC  CRISPR repeats are by definition Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short 
CC  Palindromic Repeats, described by Jansen [1]. Certain proteins,
CC  including Cas1 to Cas4, are found only in genomes with CRISPR repeats,
CC  and are near these repeats. Haft, et al. [2] have since found multiple
CC  subtypes of CRISPR/cas systems. This property describes a subtype found
CC  in Desulfotalea psychrophila LSv54, Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA,
CC  Gemmata obscuriglobus UQM 2246, Verrucomicrobium spinosum DSM 4136, and
CC  Actinomyces naeslundii MG1. Cas1 tends to be fused with Cas4 in this
CC  type. Repeats typically are 37 base pairs long.
**  ggs, ggo gan, ntdp01, GVS.  There seem to be some either-or
**  relationships: when csx17 (TIGR04113) is present, csb1 (TIGR02570) is
**  not.
**  None of the member database entries includes sequences from all of the 
**  organisms listed above.  TIGR04113 does not contain any sequences from
**  any of the five organisms mentioned above, and most of them do not
**  occur in steps csb2, csb3 and csx17.  A sequence from Desulfotalea 
**  psychrophila is present in TIGR02165; a sequence from Geobacter 
**  sulfurreducens is present in TIGR04106.
