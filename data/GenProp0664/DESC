RT  A novel sortase, SrtC2, from Streptococcus pyogenes anchors a surface
RT  protein containing a QVPTGV motif to the cell wall.

CC  This is a family of sortases and their substrates, less abundant than
CC  the housekeeping sortase, SrtA, and the LPXTG-like target sequences [1].
CC  SrtB in Listeria monocytogenes appears to process two classes of signal, 
CC  NXZTN and NPKXZ [2]. Note that the protein called SrtB in Streptococcus 
CC  pyogenes [3] is a member of the SrtA family, not the family described 
CC  here, while the protein called SrtC2 is a member of the SrtB family [4].
