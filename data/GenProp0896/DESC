CC  This small clade of ABC-type transporters are found in Actinobacteria
CC  containing numerous genes requiring the coenzyme F420. This property
CC  was defined based on five such organisms, four of which are lacking all
CC  F420 biosynthetic capability save the final side-chain polyglutamate
CC  attachment step (via the gene cofE). In Jonesia denitrificans DSM 20603 
CC  and marine actinobacterium PHSC20C1, this cassette is in an apparent 
CC  operon with the cofE gene and, in PHSC20C1, also with a F420-dependent 
CC  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Based on these observations we 
CC  propose that this is an F420-0 (F420 lacking only the polyglutamate 
CC  tail) ABC transporter.
