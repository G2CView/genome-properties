CC  CMP-N5-acetylneuraminate (CMP-Neu5Ac) is the activated version of a
CC  sugar unit found in certain glycolipids and glycoproteins. Neuraminic
CC  acid is also commonly known as sialic acid. In particular, Neu5Ac is
CC  observed in certain versions of the E. coli O-antigen [1]. CMP-Neu5Ac
CC  is synthesized in three steps: isomerization of UDP-GlcNAc to
CC  N-Acetyl-D-Mannosamine (ManNAc) catalyzed by NeuC, a condensation with 
CC  phosphoenolpyruvate to form NeuNAc catalyzed by NeuB, and an activation 
CC  with CTPcatalyzed by NeuA. A fourth gene product, NeuD is believed to 
CC  carry out O-acetyltransfers onto sialic acid but is often missing and 
CC  is also found more broadly than NeuABC
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used for GP0724 and GP0796.
