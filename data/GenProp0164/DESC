CC  The branched amino acid leucine is biosynthesized from the central
CC  intermediary metabolites pyruvate and acetyl-CoA via a seven step
CC  pathway. Four of these steps are shared with the valine and isoleucine
CC  pathways, although specialized versions of these enzymes may exist in
CC  certain species which have a narrowed substrate range or amino
CC  acid-specific regulatory mechanisms. The product of the third step in
CC  this pathway, 2-oxoisovalerate is a branchpoint metabolite required for
CC  the biosynthesis of Coenzyme A, branched-chain fatty acids and valine. 
CC  Similarly, the product of the first step, (S)-2-acetolactate is common
CC  to the pathway to (R,R)-2,3-butanediol in the mixed-acid fermentation
CC  of pyruvate. The first step of the pathway, acetolactate synthase,
CC  requires thiamine pyrophosphate and two molecules of pyruvate, one of
CC  which is decarboxylated to the acetoacetate adduct,
CC  2-(alpha-hydroxyethyl)-ThPP. The acetyl-CoA required for the fourth
CC  step, 2-isopropylmalate synthase, may also derive from this ThPP adduct
CC  by oxidation.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0162 and GP0163.
**  Evidence for step 4 is also used for GP0162 and GP0163.
