CC  This dedicated protein-sorting system occurs so far only in the class
CC  Bacteriodetes or in the genus Leptospira. The two proteins are
CC  exosortase N and a member of the vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin
CC  inhibitor (VIT) family. The VIT family protein PEP-CTERM region usually
CC  begins VPEPxEWxL, but usually scores poorly to the generic PEP-CTERM
CC  model.
