CC  This Genome Property represents a proton-motive cycle. A cycle of
CC  decarboxylating an aspartate to alanine plus CO2, then exchanging the
CC  cytosolic alanine for an extracellular asparate, has the net effect of
CC  consuming one proton. Analogous systems for antiport of substrates
CC  related by decarboxylation include, for example, the pairing of an
CC  acid-induced arginine decarboxylase with an arginine-agmatine
CC  antiporter as in Escherichia coli.
