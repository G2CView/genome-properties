CC  Defective mRNA can lead to a stalled ribosome with no stop codon to
CC  release the mRNA and nascent polypeptide. A structural RNA called tmRNA
CC  (or SsrA), charged like a tRNA with an Ala, can restart stranslation.
CC  The tmRNA, while resembling a tRNA, contains a stretch that acts as
CC  mRNA with a short coding region and stop codon. The coding region
CC  encodes a 10-amino acid tag that marks the nascent protein, once
CC  released, for rapid degradation. Small protein B (SmpB) is required for
CC  tmRNA function and has no other known function.
**  Evidence for step 1 is also used in GP0799.
