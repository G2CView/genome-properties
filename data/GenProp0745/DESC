CC  This property consists of two enzymes, lipoic acid synthetase and
CC  lipoate-protein ligase. Lipoamide-containing proteins include the
CC  glycine cleavage system and 2-osoacid dehydrogenase complexes.
**  Will need to review cutoffs for both models, correlations with proteins
**  that contains the group (e.g. glycine cleavage system), before making
**  public.
