CC  Type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module consisting of MqsR toxins bound to
CC  MqsA antitoxin dimer. TA systems act as effectors of dormancy and
CC  persistence and are composed of a toxin, which causes growth arrest by
CC  interfering with a vital cellular process, and a cognate antitoxin,
CC  which neutralizes the toxin activity during normal growth conditions. 
CC  Under conditions of stress the antitoxins are selectively degraded,
CC  leaving the toxins to exert their toxic effects, leading to growth
CC  arrest and dormancy. Type II TA complexes are small protein-protein
CC  pairs; under growth conditions, the toxin is bound to the antitoxin,
CC  which inhibits its activity. Both the antitoxin and, in most cases, the
CC  TA complex bind the TA promoter to repress transcription. Under stress
CC  conditions, cellular proteases such as Lon (P0A9M0) and ClpXP
CC  (CPX-3176) are activated that preferentially cleave the antitoxins,
CC  freeing the toxins to inhibit growth by inhibiting translation or
CC  replication, enabling cells to enter a metabolically dormant state
CC  until the stress is removed. MqsR toxin is the most up-regulated gene
CC  in the persister phenotype of cells. When active, MqsA binds its
CC  promoter with extremely tight affinity, however this is destabilized by
CC  TA complex formation as the binding sites of MqsR and MqsA on DNA 
CC  overlap and their binding is mutually exclusive. Plays a role in
CC  biofilm formation.
