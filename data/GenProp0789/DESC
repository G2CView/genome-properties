CC  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is used in cells as a methyl donor by a
CC  large guild of methyltransferases, leaving S-adenosylhomocysteine
CC  (SAH). SAH can be cleaved in one step to adenosine and homocysteine by
CC  adenosylhomocysteinase (EC 3.3.1.1). The homocysteine can then be used
CC  to regenerate methionine. Alternatively, it can be cleaved in two
CC  steps. First adenine is removed by adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase
CC  (EC 3.2.2.9) to leave S-ribosylhomocysteine. Next, 
CC  S-ribosylhomocysteinase acts to produce homocysteine and
CC  4,5-dihydroxypentan-2,3-dione, which cyclizes spontaneously and binds
CC  borate to become autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a quorum-sensing molecule
CC  produced and recognized by a wide range of bacteria. This property
CC  represents the presence of at least one of these two mechanisms to
CC  regenerate homocysteine.
**  The idea is that homocysteine is one step away from methionine, by
**  2.1.1.14 MetE TIGR01371 or various other chemistries. The use of the
**  methyl group from SAM is a large guild. TIGR01034 represents methionine
**  to SAM, but have not checked on how complete that is, and it can
**  represent other SAM uses.  The top hit by PPP is MoaA (TIGR02666), a
**  SAM-dependent enzyme or molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis, followed by
**  other Mo-related proteins.
**  Evidence for step 2 is also used for GP0800.
