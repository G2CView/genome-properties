CC  This system contains at least two proteins. One is a protein about 150
CC  amino acids in length, with the last 60 highly repetitive and usually
CC  Gly-rich. In a number of genomes, the gene call was not made. The other
CC  is a radical SAM/SPASM domain protein that may be a protein maturase 
CC  active on the amino acids in the repeat region of the Gly-rich protein.
**  Cyanobacterial members have, in addition, a putative ABC transporter
**  substrate binding protein nearby.
