CC  The branched amino acid valine is biosynthesized from the central
CC  intermediary metabolite pyruvate via a four step pathway. All four
CC  enzymes in this pathway are common to the pathways for the biosynthesis
CC  of isoleucine from 2-oxobutyrate and leucine from pyruvate, although
CC  specialized versions of these enzymes may exist in certain species
CC  which have a narrowed substrate range or amino acid-specific regulatory
CC  mechanisms. The product of the third step in this pathway,
CC  2-oxoisovalerate is a branchpoint metabolite required for the
CC  biosynthesis of Coenzyme A, branched-chain fatty acids, and leucine. 
CC  Similarly, the product of the first step, (S)-2-acetolactate is common
CC  to the pathway to (R,R)-2,3-butanediol in the mixed-acid fermentation
CC  of pyruvate. The first step of the pathway, acetolactate synthase,
CC  requires thiamine pyrophosphate and two molecules of pyruvate, one of
CC  which is decarboxylated to the acetoacetate adduct,
CC  2-(alpha-hydroxyethyl)-ThPP.
**  Evidence for step 4 is also used for GP0162 and GP0164.
