CC  Facilitates replication initiation following recruitment to each strand
CC  of the replication origin oriC by DnaA. DnaB is complexed with ATP
CC  whose hydrolysis facilitates translocation and unwinding. This process
CC  is inhibited by DnaC which needs to be displaced by the binding of
CC  primase DnaG to DnaB before DnaB can initiate its helicase
CC  function. DnaC is a weak ATPase and binds weakly to ssDNA. It acts as a
CC  regulator of DnaB activity.
