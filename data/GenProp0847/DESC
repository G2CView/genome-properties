CC  The exosporium is an outermost extra surface layer of spores formed by
CC  some members of the genus Bacillus, including pathogens B. anthracis
CC  and B. cereus. It consists of a basal layer and a nap of hair-like
CC  filaments.
**  Ah, but I have not read the pay-walled reference 2, which does not give
