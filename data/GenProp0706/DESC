CC  This property describes degradation of
CC  cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA, which is the product of benzoyl-CoA
CC  reductase activity, to 3-hydroxypimelyl-CoA, as occurs in Thauera
CC  aromatica and several other species. A different pathway occurs in
CC  Rhodopseudomonas palustris. This pathway serves the anaerobic
CC  metabolism of a number of different aromatic compounds.
