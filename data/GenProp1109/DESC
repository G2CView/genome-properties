CC  Part of the UvrABC repair system that catalyzes the recognition and
CC  processing of DNA lesions. It scans the DNA for abnormalities. Upon
CC  binding of the UvrAB complex to a putative damaged site, the DNA wraps
CC  around one of the UvrB subunits. DNA wrapping is dependent on ATP
CC  binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix,
CC  facilitating insertion of a UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands.
CC  Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a
CC  lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA
CC  preincision complex (CPX-2152) is formed. This complex is subsequently
CC  bound by UvrC (P0A8G0) and one of the UvrB monomers is released
CC  (CPX-2153). If no lesion is found, the DNA wraps around the other UvrB
CC  subunit that will check the other stand for damage. ATP hydrolysis by
CC  UvrB is UvrA-dependent and initiates dissociation of UvrB from the DNA,
CC  possibly because no lesion is found. The recruitment process of the
CC  UvrAB complex to the DNA remains unknown. A UvrA dimer exists in vitro,
CC  but it is uncertain if it also exists in vivo as UvrA is sequestered to
CC  the DNA by Mfd (CPX-2155).
