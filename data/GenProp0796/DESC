CC  Pseudaminic acid is a component of the O-antigen of certain pseudomonas
CC  strains [1] as well as the glycosylation modification of Campylobacter
CC  and Helicobacter flagellins [2], but is clearly more widely
CC  distributed. The proposed biosynthetic pathway involves the
CC  dehydration/isomerization of UDP-D-GlcNAc to UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc
CC  by PseB, and a transamination at position 4 by PseC. The PseH protein is
CC  similar to acetyltransferases and is presumed to carry out transfer to
CC  the C-4 amine. PseH itself is occasionally missing. Often in this
CC  case, the PseG protein contains a passable acetyltransferase domain.
CC  The function of PseG when PseH is present is unknown, it may complex
CC  with PseH, or it may be responsible for the UDP-hydrolysis that clearly
CC  must happen, but is not currently assigned to an enzyme with a conserved
CC  domain for this reaction. PseI carries out the condensation with
CC  phosphoenolpyruvate to create pseudaminic acid, a reaction analagous to
CC  that carried out by NeuB in the biosynthesis of neuraminic acid.
CC  PseF carries out the transfer of CMP onto pseudaminic
CC  acid to yield the most common product. In Campylobacter, the
CC  biosynthetic cluster is accompanied by the PseA protein, a homolog of
CC  WbuX and is responsible for the conversion of the N-acetyl group at
CC  position 7 into the acetimidino group. PseA is accompanied by two
CC  genes, WbuY and WbuZ which are reported to provide ammonia for the
CC  reaction. Other proteins are found associated with this cluster 
CC  including methylases and possible formyltransferases and
CC  deacetylases. Thus, a range of closely related structures are likely
CC  produced as mature products in various lineages.  
**  Evidence for step 6 is also used in GP0232 and GP0912.
