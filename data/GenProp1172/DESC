CC  Catalyzes the committed step in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis and
CC  allosterically regulates the pathway. The enzyme is activated by ATP, 
CC  inhibited by CTP and can be further inhibited by UTP, although UTP
CC  alone has little effect on activity. The catalytic mechanism is
CC  ordered, carbamoyl phosphate binds before aspartate and carbamoyl
CC  aspartate leaves before phosphate.
