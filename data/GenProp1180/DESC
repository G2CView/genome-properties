CC  Key mediator of chromosome condensation, ensuring chromosomes are
CC  efficiently separated during replication and are faithfully segregated
CC  into daughter cells. A direct interaction between ParC of Topoisomerase
CC  IV (CPX-1104) and MukB leads to a fraction of TopoIV molecules being
CC  bound to MukBEF clusters. Involved in chromosome condensation and
CC  segregation. MukB can stimulate the ability of topoisomerase IV to
CC  relax negatively supercoiled DNA.
