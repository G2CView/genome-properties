RT  The bacterium Thermus thermophilus, like hyperthermophilic archaea,
RT  uses a two-step pathway for the synthesis of mannosylglycerate.

CC  Mannosylglycerate is a compatible solute (cf. trehalose, ectoine,
CC  sucrose, glucosylglycerol, etc.) that tends to be found in highly
CC  thermophilic prokaryotes of various lineages. The more common
CC  biosynthetic pathway is a two-step pathway. Mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate
CC  synthase (EC 2.4.1.217) combines GDP-mannose with
CC  3-phospho-D-glycerate. The resultant mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate is
CC  dephosphorylated by mannosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase (EC
CC  3.1.3.70). The two enzymes are fused in Dehalococcoides ethenogenes, a
CC  rare mesophile to have this pathway.  
**  WARNING: THERE IS ALSO the supposed one-step pathway (though it
**  coexists with the two-step and I wonder if it is for degradation. I
**  should read the paper). DHH.
